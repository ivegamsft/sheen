## Entity Framework Migration

Use this skill when modernizing data layers from Entity Framework 6 or older patterns to EF Core.

## When to use

- Assessing EF6-to-EF Core migration feasibility
- Refactoring data access patterns and DbContext configuration
- Migrating model mappings and conventions
- Planning phased cutovers for schema and query behavior changes

## Inputs

- Existing data access projects and context classes
- Current migration history and database schema constraints
- Query hot paths and performance baselines

## Outputs

- EF migration approach and risk summary
- Mapping and query refactor checklist
- Validation strategy for correctness and performance
