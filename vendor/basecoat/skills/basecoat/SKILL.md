# BaseCoat Router

The front door to the BaseCoat framework. Routes requests to the right agent across
6 disciplines in two modes: **Discovery** (browse agents) and **Delegation** (route directly).

## Quick Start

```text
/basecoat                        → Full agent catalog by category
/basecoat find "deploy"          → Search agents by keyword
/basecoat backend build a REST API for orders  → Delegate to @backend-dev
```
