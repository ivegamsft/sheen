# Environment Audit Drift

Validates that environment configuration stays aligned with infrastructure and governance settings.

## What it checks

- Config drift: mapped resources and GitHub environments
- Deployment drift: manifest/version expectations
- Security drift: branch protection vs autonomy level
- Tag drift: required resource tags

## Output

`DriftReport` contains:

- Severity summary (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`)
- Findings with remediation guidance
- `actionable` flag (`false` when critical drift exists)

## Usage

```typescript
const report = await auditEnvironmentDrift({
  config_path: ".github/environment-map.yml",
  azure_subscription_id: process.env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID!,
  github_token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN!,
});

if (driftIsCritical(report)) {
  throw new Error("Critical drift detected.");
}
```
