# CI Flake Quarantine Skill

Use this skill when a test is flaky enough to temporarily isolate, but not enough
to hide the underlying defect. It pairs with `self-healing-ci` for remediation and
with `issue-triage` for tracking ownership.

## Inputs

- Flaky test name or job identifier
- Failure history and retry evidence
- Target quarantine duration or expiry policy
- Owner or team responsible for follow-up

## Workflow

1. Confirm the failure pattern is non-deterministic.
2. Check whether automated remediation has already been attempted.
3. Quarantine only with a clear expiry date and owner.
4. Record the quarantine scope and the condition that removes it.
5. Re-run the unaffected test slice and report the reduced blast radius.

## Output

```markdown
## Flake Quarantine Plan

- Test: <name>
- Evidence: <summary>
- Quarantine expires: <date>
- Owner: <team>

### Follow-up
1. Investigate root cause
2. Remove quarantine after green verification
```

## Guardrails

- Never quarantine a test without repeat evidence.
- Never make quarantine permanent by default.
- Keep the failing signal visible through issue tracking.
- Prefer remediation over quarantine when the root cause is already known.
