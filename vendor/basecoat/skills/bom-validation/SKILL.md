# BOM Validation Skill

Use this skill to validate that a workcell BOM is complete and safe before downstream work begins.

## Workflow

1. Check that all required cells are declared.
2. Confirm resource IDs exist in the plant registry.
3. Reject circular dependencies.
4. Validate CAF naming conventions.
5. Return a short pass/fail summary with the blocker list.

## Non-Goals

- Do not infer missing resources.
- Do not approve a BOM that fails schema or naming checks.
