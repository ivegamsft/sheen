# Orphaned PR Triage Skill

Use this skill to standardize stale PR cleanup and keep merge queues actionable.

## Reference Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`references/triage-checklist.md`](references/triage-checklist.md) | Candidate detection, bucketing, and action templates |
| [`../backlog-revalidation/references/classification-contract.md`](../backlog-revalidation/references/classification-contract.md) | Shared issue/PR revalidation classes and evidence contract |

## Agent Pairing

- `orphaned-pr-cleanup`
- `issue-triage`
- `backlog-revalidation` for evidence-based classification of old PRs (inactivity is a filter, not a close reason)
- `merge-coordinator`
