# Queue Rebalancer Skill

Use this skill to run a fast unblock lane when older PRs or issues are breaking downstream work.

## Workflow

1. Build a dependency graph from open PRs and issues (`Blocks`, `Blocked by`, `Depends on`, linked close references).
2. Classify edges as hard or soft dependencies and capture rationale per edge.
3. Map work into executable feature clusters with confidence and rationale.
4. Rank blockers by unblock impact (most blocked dependents first).
5. Form a small unblock group from both issue queue and PR queue.
6. Cherry-pick or merge only minimal fix commits required to unblock.
7. In `rebalance` mode, emit blocker-critical-path output for sequencing decisions.
8. Run targeted tests and verify blocker resolution.
9. Return remaining work to regular dependency order.

## Unblock Group Rules

- Group only contains items that unblock active breakage.
- Prefer existing fix commits over new broad changes.
- Keep scope narrow and execution speed high.
- Do not include independent non-blocking backlog items.

## Scope and Safety Gates

- If a proposed fix expands into new feature scope, pause and request explicit human check-in before proceeding.
- Do not redesign or spec a brand-new feature set while executing unblock work.
- Feature-introducing changes require matching tests before promotion.
- If tests are missing, mark as blocked (`gate:no-tests`) and keep out of the unblock group.

## Output

- Hard/soft dependency graph with edge rationale
- Feature clusters with confidence and rationale
- Reordered blocker-first queue
- Unblock group list (issues + PRs selected for fast lane)
- Critical-path output for `rebalance` mode
- Gated items requiring tests or explicit check-in
- Verification summary and handoff back to regular queue order
