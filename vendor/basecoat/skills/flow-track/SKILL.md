# Flow Track Skill

Use this skill to monitor delivery flow continuously and trigger early corrective
guidance when metrics trend in the wrong direction.

## When to Use

- Producing weekly or sprint flow scorecards
- Detecting sustained drift in queue delay or PR age
- Tracking CI waste and flaky rerun trends over time
- Suggesting corrective actions based on metric movement

## Workflow

1. Gather time-series flow metrics.
2. Compare current values to baseline and target thresholds.
3. Flag regressions and identify correlated flow-stage changes.
4. Propose corrective actions with expected KPI impact.
5. Publish trend report and escalation notes.

## Output

- Time-based flow scorecard
- Regression and threshold alert set
- Action recommendations with expected KPI lift
