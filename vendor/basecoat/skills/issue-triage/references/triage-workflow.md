# Issue Triage Workflow

Step-by-step decision guide for each triage check. Use this as a reference when running the `issue-triage` agent or the triage scripts manually.

---

## 0. Before You Start

```bash
# Confirm you are authenticated
gh auth status

# Set target repo (defaults to current repo if inside a git clone)
export OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner --jq '.owner.login')
export REPO=$(gh repo view --json name --jq '.name')
export DRY_RUN=false   # set to true to preview only
```

---

## Check 1: Validity

**Goal**: Remove noise and reopen wrongly closed valid issues.

### Decision Tree

```text
Issue exists?
├── Contains mojibake/encoding corruption (`�`, `Ã`, `Â`, `â€™`, `â€œ`)? → Flag: needs-info + needs-triage (do not auto-close)
├── Is body <20 chars or purely gibberish? → Close: invalid
├── Is it a duplicate of a spam pattern? → Close: invalid + comment
├── Is it a previously closed issue with valid repro? → Reopen + remove invalid label
└── Is it missing required fields?
    ├── Bug: needs steps-to-reproduce and expected/actual behavior → needs-info
    ├── Enhancement: needs problem statement → needs-info
    └── Otherwise: actionable as-is → proceed
```

### gh Commands

```bash
# Close invalid
gh issue close $N --comment "Closing as invalid: [reason]. If this is actionable, please reopen with steps to reproduce or a clear problem statement."
gh issue edit $N --add-label "invalid"

# Reopen valid
gh issue reopen $N --comment "Reopening: this issue contains valid reproduction steps that were not addressed before closure."
gh issue edit $N --remove-label "invalid" --add-label "needs-triage"

# Flag needs-info
gh issue edit $N --add-label "needs-info"
gh issue comment $N --body "This issue needs more information before it can be triaged:\n- [ ] Steps to reproduce\n- [ ] Expected vs actual behavior\n- [ ] Environment details"
```

---

## Check 2: Duplicate Detection

**Goal**: Consolidate duplicate issues to the canonical tracker.

### Detection Method

1. Extract key terms from the title (strip stop words, keep nouns/verbs/error codes).
2. Search with `gh issue list --search "<terms>"`.
3. Calculate token overlap between titles.
4. If overlap >80%: duplicate. If 50–80%: possible duplicate (flag for human review).

### gh Commands

```bash
# Search for potential duplicates
gh issue list --state open --search "$SEARCH_TERMS" --json number,title,state

# Mark as duplicate and close
gh issue edit $NEW --add-label "duplicate"
# Enforce duplicate/type exclusivity
gh issue edit $NEW --remove-label "bug" --remove-label "enhancement" --remove-label "documentation" --remove-label "chore" --remove-label "security" --remove-label "question"
gh issue comment $NEW --body "Duplicate of #$CANONICAL — closing in favor of the original tracker.\nAll updates should go to #$CANONICAL."
gh issue close $NEW --reason "not planned"

# If canonical was wrongly closed, reopen it first
gh issue reopen $CANONICAL --comment "Reopening as the primary tracker. A duplicate (#$NEW) was filed while this was closed."
```

---

## Check 3: Closed Issue Verification

**Goal**: Catch issues closed without actual resolution.

### Detection Method

1. List issues closed in the last 30 days.
2. For each: search for PRs that reference it (`closes #N`, `fixes #N`, `resolves #N`).
3. If a merged PR is found: check whether it modifies files related to the issue area.
4. If no PR found: check commits mentioning `#N`.

### gh Commands

```bash
# Find closed issues in last 30 days
gh issue list --state closed --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,closedAt,stateReason \
  | jq '[.[] | select(.closedAt > (now - 2592000 | todate))]'

# Find PRs that close an issue
gh pr list --state merged --search "closes #$N" --json number,title,mergedAt

# Check which files a PR touched
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files --jq '.files[].path'

# Reopen if no resolution found
gh issue reopen $N --comment "Reopening: no merged pull request or commit was found that resolves this issue. Please link the fixing PR or provide evidence of resolution."
gh issue edit $N --add-label "needs-verification"
```

---

## Check 4: Label and Type Enforcement

**Goal**: Ensure every issue has the minimum required labels.

### Minimum Required Labels

| Category | Required | Valid values |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Type | 1 | `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`, `security`, `question` |
| Priority | 1 | `priority:critical`, `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low` |
| Sprint | 1 | `sprint:<number>` |
| Area | 0–1 | `area/*` labels defined in repo |

Legacy labels (`P0-critical`, `P1-high`, `P2-medium`, `P3-low`, `priority/critical`, `priority/high`, `priority/medium`, `priority/low`) are migration-only and should be normalized to canonical `priority:*` labels during triage runs.
Repo-specific delivery labels such as `area/*`, `sprint:*`, and legacy `sprint-*` labels must be preserved during cleanup; only governance labels should be normalized automatically.

### Inference Rules

| Signal in title/body | Inferred type |
|---------------------|---------------|
| "error", "crash", "fail", "broken", "regression" | `bug` |
| "add", "support", "allow", "feature", "request" | `enhancement` |
| "doc", "readme", "guide", "typo", "spelling" | `documentation` |
| "CVE", "vuln", "secret", "injection", "XSS" | `security` |
| "refactor", "cleanup", "debt", "upgrade" | `chore` |
| "how", "why", "what", "clarify", "explain" | `question` |

### gh Commands

```bash
# Check labels on an issue
gh issue view $N --json labels --jq '.labels[].name'

# Apply inferred labels
gh issue edit $N --add-label "bug,priority:high"

# Flag for manual triage
gh issue edit $N --add-label "needs-triage,needs-info"
gh issue comment $N --body "This issue is missing required labels:\n- [ ] Type: bug / enhancement / documentation / chore / security / question\n- [ ] Priority: priority:critical / priority:high / priority:medium / priority:low\n- [ ] Sprint: sprint:<number> (for example, sprint:35)"
```

---

## Check 5: Title Quality

**Goal**: Ensure titles are descriptive and searchable.

### Quality Rules

| Rule | Pass | Fail |
|------|------|------|
| Length ≥10 chars | "Login fails on mobile Safari" | "bug" |
| Contains meaningful word | "Add dark mode support" | "issue with thing" |
| Not a generic stop phrase | "OAuth callback 500 error" | "fix", "help", "todo" |
| Not duplicate of existing title | Unique title | Same as #123 |

### Comment Template

```markdown
**Suggested title improvement**

The current title `{current_title}` is too generic to be useful in search or sprint planning.

Suggested: `{suggested_title}`

Please update the title if this better reflects the issue. The agent will not rename it automatically.
```

---

## Check 6: Proposed Fixes and Related Linkage

**Goal**: Surface related code, issues, and suggested resolutions.

### Comment Template

```markdown
## Related Files
<!-- Files likely related to this issue, found via keyword search -->
- `src/auth/callback.ts` — contains OAuth callback handler
- `src/middleware/token.ts` — token validation logic

## Related Issues
- #145 — OAuth token refresh fails after 1 hour (related)
- #201 — Add PKCE support for OAuth flow (parent)

## Related PRs
- #PR-198 — Partial fix for callback URL handling (merged)

## Proposed Resolution
Based on the error message `invalid_grant` in the body, this is likely caused by token expiry not being handled in `callback.ts`. A guard clause checking token age before exchange should resolve it.
```

---

## Check 7: Relationship Audit

**Goal**: Make implicit relationships explicit.

### Relationship Keywords

| Pattern found | Inferred relationship | Marker to add |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| `#N` in body without keyword | `mentions` | `Mentions #N` |
| "blocked by #N" | `blocked-by` | Add `blocked` label; comment `Blocked by #N` |
| "depends on #N" | `depends-on` | Comment `Depends on #N` |
| "part of #N" | `child-of` | Comment `Part of #N` |
| "after #N" / "once #N" | `depends-on` | Comment `Depends on #N` |

### gh Commands

```bash
# Add blocked label
gh issue edit $N --add-label "blocked"
gh issue comment $N --body "Blocked by #$BLOCKER — cannot proceed until that issue is resolved."
```

---

## Check 8: Branch Connection

**Goal**: Link open branches and missing PRs to their issues.

### Search Pattern

```bash
# List all branches
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/branches" --paginate --jq '.[].name' \
  | grep -E "^(feat|fix|chore|copilot)/$N-"

# Check if a PR exists for a branch
gh pr list --head "$BRANCH_NAME" --json number,state
```

### Comment Template

````markdown
**Open branch found**

Branch `fix/245-oauth-callback` exists but no pull request is linked to this issue.

If work is in progress, consider opening a PR to track it:
```bash
gh pr create --head fix/245-oauth-callback --base main --title "fix: OAuth callback error" --body "Closes #245"
```
````

---

## Check 9: Priority Review

**Goal**: Calibrate priorities to actual risk and age.

### Auto-escalation Rules

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `security` label + no `priority:critical` | Add `priority:critical` |
| Open >90 days + no activity | Add `stale` |
| Open >30 days + `bug` + has repro steps | Add `priority:high` if no priority set |
| No priority label at all | Apply `priority:low` as floor |

### gh Commands

```bash
# Upgrade to critical
gh issue edit $N --add-label "priority:critical"
gh issue comment $N --body "Priority escalated to critical: security issues are automatically assigned critical priority per triage policy."

# Mark stale
gh issue edit $N --add-label "stale"
gh issue comment $N --body "This issue has been open for >90 days with no activity. Marking as stale. If still relevant, please add a comment to keep it active."
```

---

## Check 10: PRD/Spec Pre-flight

**Goal**: Warn early when an enhancement will require a PRD and spec link before its PR can merge, preventing downstream blocking at the `prd-spec-gate`.

### When to Run

Run this check for every `enhancement` issue. Also run for `chore` or `documentation`
issues whose body references risky paths (`skills/`, `agents/`, `instructions/`,
`scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`).

### Decision Tree

```text
Issue type == enhancement (or body mentions risky paths)?
├── Yes → does the issue body contain a PRD link (text matching /prd/i) OR a spec link (/\bspec\b|technical specification/i)?
│   ├── Yes → no action needed; PRD/spec pre-flight passes
│   └── No → add `needs-prd` label; post advisory comment (see template below)
└── No → skip this check
```

### Advisory Comment Template

```markdown
## PRD/Spec Pre-flight Advisory

This issue is classified as an **enhancement** that is likely to touch risky paths
(`skills/`, `agents/`, `instructions/`, `scripts/`, or `.github/workflows/`).

Any pull request for this work will be **blocked by the PRD/spec gate** unless the PR
description contains both a PRD link and a spec link (or the `skip-prd-spec-check`
label is applied).

To resolve before opening a PR:

1. Create or link the PRD document in this issue body.
2. Create or link the technical spec in this issue body.
3. Copy both links to the PR description when you open the PR.

Standard format (add to both this issue and the PR description):

PRD: https://example.com/prd
Spec: https://example.com/spec

Once these links are added to this issue, remove the `needs-prd` label.
```

### gh Commands

```bash
# Flag issue as needing PRD/spec before a PR can merge
gh issue edit $N --add-label "needs-prd"
gh issue comment $N --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## PRD/Spec Pre-flight Advisory
...
EOF
)"

# Remove once links are added
gh issue edit $N --remove-label "needs-prd"
```
