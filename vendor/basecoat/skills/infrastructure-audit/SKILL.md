# Infrastructure Audit Skill

Comprehensive auditing of Infrastructure-as-Code implementations, resource configurations, networking architecture, and cloud deployment configurations.

## USE FOR

- Reviewing Bicep and Terraform code for best practices
- Validating resource configurations and compliance
- Assessing networking architecture and security group rules
- Identifying security misconfigurations and compliance violations
- Analyzing resource sizing and cost optimization opportunities
- Evaluating high-availability and disaster recovery configurations
- Reviewing secrets and credential handling in IaC
- Assessing tagging strategies and resource organization
- Identifying dependencies and deployment order issues
- Creating structured audit findings with remediation guidance

## DO NOT USE FOR

- Writing IaC from scratch (use `infrastructure` or `infrastructure-design` skills)
- Provisioning infrastructure
- Network architecture design
- Application development
- CI/CD workflow creation (use `devops-audit` skill)

## Audit Checklist

- **Code Quality**: Modularity, reusability, clarity, documentation
- **Best Practices**: Naming conventions, resource organization, consistency
- **Security**: Encryption, access control, secrets management, compliance
- **Performance**: Resource sizing, scalability, throughput configuration
- **Reliability**: Redundancy, failover, disaster recovery, backup strategy
- **Cost**: Right-sizing, reserved capacity, resource elimination
- **Monitoring**: Alerting, logging, diagnostic settings, observability
- **Networking**: Security groups, network policies, routing, isolation
- **Compliance**: Standards adherence, audit logging, regulatory requirements
- **Dependencies**: Module dependencies, deployment order, state management
