# Azure Identity & Entra ID Skill

Design and implement Azure identity and access management — RBAC hierarchies, managed identities, Entra ID app registrations, conditional access policies, and workload identity federation.

## Templates in This Skill

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rbac-role-assignment-template.md` | RBAC role assignment matrix — principal-to-role-to-scope mappings |
| `managed-identity-mapping-template.md` | Managed identity catalogue — system-assigned and user-assigned per workload |
| `app-registration-checklist.md` | Entra ID app registration — API permissions, credentials, token configuration |
| `workload-identity-federation-template.md` | GitHub Actions OIDC and external identity provider federation |
| `conditional-access-policy-template.md` | Zero trust conditional access — users, devices, applications |

## Agent Pairing

Use with `identity-architect` agent. For IaC provisioning pair with `devops-engineer`; for app auth pair with `backend-dev` or `frontend-dev`; for threat modeling pair with `security-analyst`.
