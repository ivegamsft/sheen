| `platform-subscription-template.bicep` | Platform subscription (Connectivity, Identity, or Management) |
| `hub-networking-template.bicep` | Hub VNet, Azure Firewall, DNS Private Resolver, Bastion, and gateway |
| `policy-assignment-template.json` | Azure Policy initiative assignment for regulatory baselines |
| `policy-exemption-template.json` | Azure Policy exemption with justification and expiration fields |
| `landing-zone-vending-template.bicep` | Vending a new application landing zone subscription |
