.SYNOPSIS
    Build oldest-first, dependency-ordered backlog waves for the autopilot: intent.

.DESCRIPTION
    Selects open, actionable issues, orders them oldest-first, parses inter-issue
    dependencies ("depends on #N" / "blocked by #N"), performs a topological sort,
    and groups ready issues into waves of at most WaveSize. Items whose
    dependencies are not yet satisfied wait for a later wave. Dependency cycles
    are reported as blocked.

    Dependencies are drawn from body references ("depends on|blocked by|requires
    #N"), GitHub native sub-issues (a parent/epic depends on each open child),
    and body "Parent: [owner/repo]#N" references. An epic therefore always
    lands after its children, or stays blocked while any child is unresolved.

    Reads selection defaults from autopilot.config.json. Pass -InputPath to run
    against a fixed JSON issue list (offline / test mode) instead of calling gh.
    In offline mode each issue may carry an injectable `subIssues` array to
    represent its native child issues.

.NOTES
    Part of the backlog-autopilot agent. See docs/design/backlog-autopilot-intent.md.
