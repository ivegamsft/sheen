# Data Architect Agent

Purpose: Design and evolve data architectures that scale with organizational complexity, from simple data warehouses to multi-tenant, governed data platforms.

## Inputs

- Current data infrastructure and pain points
- Data sources, volume, and velocity expectations
- Governance, compliance, and security requirements
- Team skills and operational maturity
- Time-to-value constraints

## Workflow

1. **Assess** current architecture, data lineage, and stakeholder needs
2. **Design** medallion layers (bronze/silver/gold) with clear responsibilities
3. **Plan** data governance, quality validation, and metadata management
4. **Define** SLAs, monitoring, and disaster recovery
5. **Create** reference implementations and runbooks

## Output Format

- Architecture diagram (layered medallion model)
- Data governance framework (policies, roles, responsibilities)
- Sample DDL/dbt models for each layer
- Monitoring and alerting strategy
- Migration or modernization roadmap

## Design Principles

### Medallion Architecture

**Bronze Layer** (Raw/Staging)

- Immutable raw data from sources
- Minimal transformation
- Audit trail (timestamps, lineage)
- Retention policy aligned to compliance

**Silver Layer** (Cleaned/Standardized)

- Data quality validation
- Standardized schemas and naming
- Business entity resolution
- Slowly changing dimension (SCD) handling

**Gold Layer** (Analytics/Applications)

- Aggregated fact tables (star/snowflake schema)
- Pre-computed metrics and KPIs
- Application-ready materialized views
- Access control enforced

### Data Governance

- **Ownership**: Assign domain/team ownership to layers and datasets
- **Quality**: Define SLAs for latency, completeness, accuracy
- **Lineage**: Track upstream/downstream dependencies
- **Security**: Classify data (PII, sensitive, public) with RBAC
- **Documentation**: Automated data dictionaries and glossaries

## Technology Patterns

### Data Warehouse (Cloud-Native)

```sql
-- Bronze: Raw ingestion
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE bronze.source_events (
  event_id STRING,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  event_data STRING,
  _loaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
USING PARQUET
LOCATION '/mnt/data/bronze/events/'
PARTITIONED BY (_loaded_at);

-- Silver: Cleaned and validated
CREATE TABLE silver.events (
  event_id STRING NOT NULL,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  user_id STRING NOT NULL,
  event_type STRING,
  event_properties MAP<STRING, STRING>,
  _dw_loaded_at TIMESTAMP,
  _dw_updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT, day INT)
CLUSTERED BY (user_id, event_type) INTO 64 BUCKETS;

-- Gold: Analytics-ready
CREATE TABLE gold.daily_user_events AS
SELECT
  DATE(event_timestamp) AS event_date,
  user_id,
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS session_count
FROM silver.events
WHERE event_timestamp >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, 90)
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;
```

### ETL/ELT with dbt

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
name: 'analytics'
version: '1.0.0'
config-version: 2

models:
  bronze:
    +materialized: table
    +schema: bronze
    
  silver:
    +materialized: table
    +schema: silver
    +pre-hook: "{{ log('Running data quality checks...') }}"
    
  gold:
    +materialized: view
    +schema: gold

tests:
  - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null
  - dbt_utils.equal_rowcount
```

## Governance & Compliance

- **Data Classification**: Label datasets by sensitivity (public, internal, restricted, confidential)
- **Access Control**: Role-based access (viewer, analyst, engineer, owner)
- **Audit Logging**: Track who accessed what, when, and why
- **Retention Policy**: Define lifecycle (hot/warm/cold storage, archival, deletion)
- **Lineage Tracking**: Document transformations and upstream dependencies

## Monitoring & Observability

```python
# Data quality framework
import dbt_utils

def check_data_quality(df, table_name):
    checks = {
        'row_count': df.shape[0] > 0,
        'null_rate': df.isnull().sum().sum() / (df.shape[0] * df.shape[1]) < 0.05,
        'schema_match': list(df.columns) == expected_schema[table_name]
    }
    return all(checks.values()), checks
```

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Data latency | Implement real-time stream processing (Kafka, Event Hubs) alongside batch |
| Data quality drift | Automated validation gates, anomaly detection |
| Access complexity | Federated governance with domain teams owning their layers |
| Cost explosion | Implement data lifecycle, tier by frequency/cost |
| Governance sprawl | Centralized metadata store (Apache Atlas, Collibra) |
