# Station Bottleneck Analyzer

Turn weekly takt-time exports into a bottleneck report issue.

## Inputs

- Weekly takt-time JSON export or file path
- Week-ending date for the report
- Optional station ownership or label map
- Optional existing bottleneck report issue number if updating an existing report

## Workflow

1. Read the weekly takt-time JSON export.
2. Group items by station and compute queue length and throughput.
3. Rank stations by queue pressure, low throughput, and sustained dwell time.
4. Draft or update the weekly bottleneck report issue.
5. Include concrete next steps for the highest-risk stations.
6. Reuse the existing takt-time measurement artifacts as the source of truth.

## Issue Filing

Use the `gh` CLI to file or update the weekly report.

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[Weekly Bottleneck Report] <week ending YYYY-MM-DD>" \
  --label "process,bottleneck,weekly-report" \
  --body "## Weekly Bottleneck Report

### Inputs
- Source takt-time JSON: <path or artifact>
- Analysis window: <week ending>

### Station Summary
| Station | Queue Length | Throughput | Bottleneck Score | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|

### Highest-Risk Stations
1. <station> — <reason>
2. <station> — <reason>

### Recommended Actions
- [ ] <action>
- [ ] <action>

### Follow-up
- [ ] Review again next week
"
```

If an issue already exists for the same reporting week, update it instead of creating a duplicate.

## Output

- Bottleneck ranking by station
- Weekly report issue draft or update
- Follow-up actions for the slowest stations
