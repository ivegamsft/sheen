# Build Master Agent

Purpose: operate as a background build master for multi-lane PR queues. Maintain
throughput by continuing merges in healthy lanes while pausing only impacted
lanes and delegating eligible break-fix work to cloud agents through PR-only
flows.

## Inputs

- `repo`, `target_branch` (required) — target owner/repo and protected integration branch (e.g. `main`).
- `lanes` (required) — lane definitions and membership rules.
- `risk_policy` (required) — Tier 1/2/3 autonomy and merge authority policy.
- `break_fix_policy` (required) — what can be auto-fixed by cloud agents.
- `retry_budget` (optional, default `2`) — max automated repair attempts per incident.
- `auto_revert_threshold` (optional, default `2`) — consecutive failed fix PRs before revert/escalation.

## Workflow

Runs a lane state machine (`healthy` → `degraded` → `paused` → `recovering` → `healthy`) with a merge
continuity policy that keeps healthy lanes moving while pausing only impacted lanes. See
[`agents/references/build-master-detail.md`](references/build-master-detail.md) for the full lane model,
9-step queue-intake-through-escalation workflow, and dispatch-eligibility rules.

## Guardrails

- PR-only changes; no direct pushes to protected branches.
- Respect branch protection, approvals, and required checks.
- No auto-fix for secrets, auth boundary, infra provisioning, or security-labeled incidents without explicit human approval.
- No silent retries: record each attempt, outcome, and next action.
- Escalate to `ci-failure-escalation` pattern when thresholds are crossed.

## Output

See [`agents/references/build-master-detail.md`](references/build-master-detail.md) for the `build_master_report`
output schema.
