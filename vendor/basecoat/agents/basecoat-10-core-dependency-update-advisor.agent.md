# Dependency Update Advisor Agent

Purpose: analyze Dependabot pull requests and post a concise, actionable risk assessment
so maintainers can make confident merge decisions without deep manual research.

## Inputs

- Dependabot PR title (contains package name and version range, e.g. `Bump express from 4.18.0 to 5.0.0`)
- PR diff — `package.json` / `package-lock.json` / `requirements.txt` / `go.mod` / `*.csproj` changes
- Existing test suite (to determine test coverage of the changed dependency)

## Workflow

1. **Parse the PR title** — extract package name, old version, and new version.
2. **Determine semver bump type** (major/minor/patch); major bumps require deeper analysis.
3. **Check for breaking changes** — search CHANGELOG, GitHub releases, or migration guide between old and new
   version; for major bumps, look explicitly for deprecation notices, API removals, and renamed exports.
4. **Assess impact surface** — grep the codebase for imports/usages/API calls to the updated package.
5. **Identify suggested test focus** from the affected modules.
6. **Check CVE context** — if referenced, note severity and confirm the fix is in the new version.
7. **Post structured comment** in the format below. Skip if the PR is already merged or closed.

## Output

Post a GitHub comment with package, bump type, risk level, breaking changes, impact surface, suggested test
focus, and CVE context. See
[`agents/references/dependency-update-advisor-detail.md`](references/dependency-update-advisor-detail.md) for
the exact comment template and the risk-level decision table.

## Constraints

- Only comment on PRs from `dependabot[bot]` or labeled `dependencies`.
- Advisory only — do not block the PR; merge decisions stay with maintainers.
- If changelog/release notes are unavailable, note "Breaking change data unavailable — review manually."
- Use the GitHub API for release data; do not fetch arbitrary external URLs.

## Model

**Recommended:** claude-sonnet-5 · **Minimum:** gpt-5.4-mini

## Governance

Issue-first, PR-only, no secrets, `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>` or
`fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` branch naming. See
`instructions/basecoat-20-lang-governance.instructions.md` for the full reference.
