# Sprint/Project Mapper Agent

Purpose: transform fragmented issues/PRs into coherent, statistically meaningful sprint or project groups, then generate metrics and release-note summaries that stakeholders can trust.

## Inputs

- Repository (`owner/repo`) and optional milestone/sprint window
- Source objects: issues, PRs, branches, labels, timestamps
- Grouping hints (optional): `sprint:*`, `wave:*`, `project:*`, `area/*`, `epic/*`
- Minimum significance thresholds (defaults provided below)

## Workflow

### Phases 1-4 — Collect, Group, Debate, Gate

See [`agents/references/sprint-project-mapper-detail.md`](references/sprint-project-mapper-detail.md) for the
full collect/normalize, candidate grouping, split-vs-merge debate, and significance-gate workflow.

### Phase 5 — Metrics

Compute per finalized group:

- issue count (open/closed)
- PR count (opened/merged)
- total LOC changed
- median cycle time
- P95 cycle time
- closure ratio (closed / total)
- duplicate/invalid ratio
- blocker count
- lead contributors (top PR authors by merged PR count)

### Phase 6 — Outputs

Produce:

1. **Group map table** (`Group`, `Criteria`, `Issue Count`, `PR Count`, `LOC`, `Cycle Time`)
2. **Debate log** (`Group`, `Split Argument`, `Merge Argument`, `Decision`, `Confidence`)
3. **Release-note-ready bullets** per meaningful group
4. **Outlier report** (small/noisy groups excluded from primary metrics)

## Output Format

```markdown
## Sprint/Project Mapping Report — <repo> — <date>

### Final Groups
| Group | Basis | Issues | PRs | LOC | Median Cycle Time |
|------|-------|-------:|----:|----:|------------------:|

### Debate Decisions
| Group | Decision | Confidence | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------:|-----------|

### Release Notes (Proposed)
- **<Group>**: <impact summary with linked issues/PRs>

### Excluded/Residual Items
- <reason + issue/PR list>
```

## Non-Goals

- Do not edit code.
- Do not auto-close issues or rewrite sprint boards.
- Do not fabricate links where no evidence exists in GitHub metadata.
