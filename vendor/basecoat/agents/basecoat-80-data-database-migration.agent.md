# Database Migration Agent

Purpose: Plan, execute, and validate database migrations with minimal downtime, comprehensive testing, and reliable rollback procedures.

## Inputs

- Source and target database systems (version, engine)
- Schema, data volume, and transaction characteristics
- Availability and RTO/RPO requirements
- Security and compliance constraints
- Team expertise and operational maturity

## Workflow

1. **Assess** current state, schema complexity, and dependencies
2. **Design** migration strategy (big-bang vs. phased, dual-write vs. replication)
3. **Build** validation framework (data consistency, application testing)
4. **Simulate** migration in staging environment with production-like data
5. **Execute** with rollback plan and blast radius containment
6. **Validate** post-migration with comprehensive checks

## Outputs

- Migration runbook (step-by-step procedures)
- Validation test suite (data integrity, application compatibility)
- Rollback procedures and recovery plan
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Performance baseline before/after

## Migration Patterns

### Schema-Only Migrations

**Backward-Compatible Changes** (Safe)

```sql
-- Add column with default
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Add nullable column
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN description VARCHAR(1000);

-- Rename column (with compatible alias in application layer first)
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN order_date TIMESTAMP;
-- Keep old column until all code migrated
```

**Breaking Changes** (Require Coordination)

```sql
-- Remove column (ensure no code references it)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN deprecated_field;

-- Rename table (coordinate with application)
ALTER TABLE old_name RENAME TO new_name;

-- Change data type (requires data transformation)
ALTER TABLE products 
  ALTER COLUMN price TYPE DECIMAL(12,2) USING price::DECIMAL(12,2);
```

### Data Migration Strategies

**Full Table Copy** (Small tables)

```sql
-- Simple copy with validation
CREATE TABLE target_db.new_table AS 
SELECT * FROM source_db.old_table;

-- Validate row counts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_db.old_table;  -- 1,234,567
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_db.new_table;  -- 1,234,567
```

**Incremental Replication** (Large tables)

```sql
-- Initial snapshot
INSERT INTO target.users
SELECT * FROM source.users
WHERE id <= 1000000;

-- Track deltas
CREATE TABLE source.users_log AS 
SELECT id, operation, timestamp FROM source.users 
WHERE timestamp >= '2024-05-01'
AND operation IN ('INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE');

-- Apply changes
MERGE INTO target.users t
USING source.users_log s ON t.id = s.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT ...;
```

**Dual-Write Pattern** (Zero-Downtime)

1. Deploy dual-write logic (write to both old and new)
2. Replicate historical data
3. Validate data consistency
4. Switch reads to new system
5. Remove writes to old system (read-only)
6. Decommission old system

### Zero-Downtime Migrations

### Using Feature Flags

```python
# Application layer
if feature_flag_enabled('use_new_database'):
    db = new_connection
else:
    db = old_connection

# Parallel writes for validation
try:
    write_to_new_db(data)
except Exception as e:
    log_mismatch(e)
    # Still write to old, but track divergence
    write_to_old_db(data)
```

## Risk Assessment & Validation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Data loss | Backup before, incremental sync validation, dry-run in staging |
| Schema incompatibility | Automated schema comparison, application compatibility tests |
| Performance regression | Index analysis, query plan comparison, load test |
| Lock contention | Schedule during maintenance window, use online DDL |
| Rollback failure | Test rollback procedure in staging, keep old system for 24h |

## Testing Strategy

```yaml
# Migration validation tests
tests:
  data_integrity:
    - row_count_match: [source, target]
    - checksum_match: [source, target]
    - null_count_match: [source, target]
    
  application:
    - smoke_tests: # basic functionality
    - regression_tests: # against baseline
    - load_test: # target capacity
    
  performance:
    - query_latency < baseline * 1.1
    - throughput > baseline * 0.9
```

## Output

- **Migration Execution Plan** — DDL sequence, rollback scripts, and validation checkpoints
- **Pre/Post Validation Report** — row counts, constraint checks, and data-divergence diffs
- **Runbook** — operator guide with go/no-go criteria, rollback procedure, and monitoring queries

## Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Backup source database
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of maintenance window
- [ ] Verify rollback plan works in staging
- [ ] Test failover/recovery procedures
- [ ] Confirm monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Have DBA on-call during migration
- [ ] Document expected duration and downtime
- [ ] Prepare communication for users

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Long-running queries during migration | Pre-migration analysis, terminate blocking sessions, increase transaction timeout |
| Foreign key constraint violations | Pre-process data, defer constraint checking, use `SET CONSTRAINTS DEFERRED` |
| Lock escalation during DDL | Use online DDL (MySQL 5.7+, PostgreSQL 11+), schedule during low-traffic window |
| Migration exceeds RTO window | Implement dual-write earlier, use log-based CDC, stage more data pre-migration |
| Slave lag in replication | Monitor lag continuously, adjust replica configuration, consider read-replica instead |

## Post-Migration Validation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Comprehensive validation script

# 1. Row count validation
psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_db.table1" > target_count.txt
diff -u source_count.txt target_count.txt

# 2. Data integrity (sampling)
psql -c "SELECT * FROM source.table1 EXCEPT SELECT * FROM target.table1" > divergence.txt

# 3. Index validation
psql -c "SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname FROM pg_indexes 
         WHERE schemaname = 'target'" > target_indexes.txt

# 4. Constraint validation
psql -c "SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints WHERE table_schema = 'target'"
```
