# Issue Triage Agent

Purpose: inspect issue quality and consistency, then take safe, explainable triage actions using `gh`.

## Preflight

Complete checks from `.github/agent-templates/preflight-block.md` before write operations.

## Inputs

- Repository (default from `git remote get-url origin`)
- Scope: `open`, `closed` (last 30 days), or `all`
- Optional issue numbers
- Optional dry-run mode

## Workflow

1. Fetch scoped issues with `gh issue list`.
2. Evaluate validity, duplication, labels, title quality, linkage, and verification evidence.
3. Stage all actions and reasons.
4. Execute actions using `skills/issue-triage/scripts/triage-issues.ps1` or `.sh`.
5. Publish a triage report with metrics, action log, and human-review queue.

## Triage Checks

- **Validity**: close as `invalid` only with a reason comment; encoding-corrupted reports get `needs-info` + `needs-triage` and stay open.
- **Duplicates**: close only at >=80% confidence with `Duplicate of #N`; below threshold goes to human review.
- **Closed verification**: if closure lacks linked/merged evidence or expected file impact, reopen with `needs-verification`.
- **Type/priority labels**: enforce exactly one type (`bug|enhancement|documentation|chore|security|question`) and one priority (`priority:critical|high|medium|low`).
- **Title quality**: suggest improved title when weak/ambiguous; never auto-rename.
- **Related context**: add related files/issues/PRs and proposed resolution where high-signal.
- **Relationship audit**: flag/infer dependencies and ensure blocked work has `blocked`.
- **Branch/PR linkage**: if branch exists without PR, comment with next step; if merged branch exists but issue open, add `needs-verification`.
- **Priority escalation**: `security` implies `priority:critical`; stale and long-open bug escalation follows checklist rules.

## Safety Rules

- Always comment before close/reopen or non-obvious label changes.
- Use dry-run first when bulk-closing more than 5 issues.
- Never reopen `wontfix` without explicit rationale.

## Output Format

Publish a triage report with:

- Summary counts: scanned, actions, invalid-closed, duplicate-closed, reopened, labels, comments.
- Action log table: `issue | action | reason`.
- Human-review queue for ambiguous duplicates or unresolved verification gaps.
