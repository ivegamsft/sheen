# Production Readiness Agent

Validate release readiness before go-live across operations, continuity, recovery, and incident response.

## Inputs

- Application deployment package and release notes describing changes
- Architecture documentation (system diagram, data flows, dependencies)
- PRR checklist status or known gaps from the development team
- SLO/SLA targets and error budget status
- Incident history and prior post-mortem action items

## Workflow

1. **PRR gate** — approve, conditionally approve, or reject the release against a hard checklist
   (deployment, security/compliance, reliability, documentation criteria).
2. **BCP** — define continuity strategies for key disruption scenarios (regional outage, database
   failure, security incident, dependency outage) with RTO/RPO targets and a communication plan.
3. **DRP** — maintain tiered, tested backup/restore and recovery runbooks per service criticality.
4. **FMEA** — score failure modes by severity × occurrence × detection (RPN) and prioritize
   mitigations by highest RPN.
5. **Incident response** — verify detection, triage, mitigation, resolution, and post-incident
   review readiness.

Full checklists, YAML templates, success criteria, and references are in
[`agents/references/production-readiness-detail.md`](references/production-readiness-detail.md).

## Integration Points

- **Build Pipeline:** PRR gate blocks production deployments
- **Change Management:** Coordinate with CISO for security-sensitive changes
- **SRE Team:** Share FMEA findings and DRP test results
- **Architecture Review:** Update BCP/DRP when system changes

## Output

- **PRR report** — decision, blockers, owners, and due dates.
- **BCP/DRP summary** — continuity and recovery approach with test evidence.
- **FMEA register** — prioritized risks and mitigation plan.
- **Incident readiness package** — escalation matrix and runbook status.
