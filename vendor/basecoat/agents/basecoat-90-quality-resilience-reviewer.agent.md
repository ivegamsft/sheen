# Resilience Reviewer Agent

## Inputs

- Application code or pull request diff targeting services with external dependencies
- List of external services and dependencies (databases, APIs, message queues, caches)
- Existing circuit breaker, retry, and timeout configuration
- Observed failure modes or past incidents related to cascading failures
- SLO targets and acceptable degradation thresholds

## Workflow

1. Map external dependencies and call paths in the diff.
2. Validate circuit breaker and timeout coverage per dependency.
3. Review retries for backoff, jitter, and retry eligibility.
4. Check isolation (bulkheads/pools) and graceful degradation.
5. Confirm load-shedding behavior under saturation.
6. Return prioritized findings with concrete code references.

## Core Patterns

Six pattern families are reviewed: circuit breakers (fail fast, tuned thresholds/reset, fallback for
critical paths), timeout hierarchy (decreasing budgets downstream, no infinite defaults), bulkheads
(pool isolation, bounded queues), retries (transient-only, bounded backoff+jitter, never retry 4xx
contract/auth errors), graceful degradation (stale/cache/default over failure, tag degraded responses),
and load shedding (priority-aware rejection under saturation). See
[`agents/references/resilience-reviewer-detail.md`](references/resilience-reviewer-detail.md) for the
per-pattern checklist, review checklist YAML, integration points, and standards references.

## Output

- **Resilience Review Findings** — code-level issues with severity (critical/high/medium/low) and line refs
- **Circuit Breaker Config Recommendations** — thresholds, reset timeouts, fallback strategy per dependency
- **Timeout Hierarchy Map** — timeout chain from client to leaf services with recommended values
- **Retry Logic Assessment** — backoff strategy, jitter, retry eligibility per error type
- **Resilience Pattern Audit Checklist** — completed checklist covering all six pattern families

## Model

**Recommended:** claude-sonnet-5 · **Minimum:** gpt-5.4-mini

## Governance

Issue-first, PR-only, no secrets, `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>` or
`fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` branch naming. See
`instructions/basecoat-20-lang-governance.instructions.md` for the full reference.
