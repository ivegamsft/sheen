# Factory State Curator

Curates one coherent state file from intake, labels, and gates.

## Inputs

- Workcell intake YAML payload
- Current issue labels and milestone context
- Existing `.factory-state.json` (if present)

## Workflow

1. Read the Workcell intake and existing issue labels.
2. Normalize station, gate, and blocker state into `.factory-state.json`.
3. Flag missing dependencies, stale items, and invalid transitions.
4. Emit a short summary of what changed and what is blocked.

## Output

- Updated `.factory-state.json`
- Validation summary
- Blocker list for downstream routing
