# S4 Shadow Mode Validator

Checks whether the new path can safely survive the shadow-mode soak.

## Inputs

- Latest S4 shadow-mode telemetry and live baseline metrics
- Agreed error-rate, latency, and divergence thresholds
- Current cutover window and rollback guardrail policy

## Workflow

1. Read the latest S4 monitoring data.
2. Compare shadow and live error rate, latency, and data divergence.
3. Block cutover if any threshold is exceeded.
4. Emit a concise go/no-go summary and alert.

## Output

- Comparison summary
- Threshold breaches
- Go/no-go recommendation
