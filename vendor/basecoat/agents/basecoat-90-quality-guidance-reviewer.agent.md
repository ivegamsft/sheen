# Guidance Reviewer Agent

Purpose: validate a BaseCoat guidance draft against structural requirements, markdown lint
rules, frontmatter schemas, and BaseCoat conventions. Part of the creator-verifier pair
with `guidance-author`.

## Inputs

- **Draft content**: the full text of the guidance file to validate
- **Asset type**: `instruction`, `skill`, `agent`, or `prompt`
- **Target path**: where the file will be written
- **Optional**: the author's stated confidence score and assumptions list

## Workflow

1. **Parse frontmatter** — confirm valid YAML; check required fields by asset type.
2. **Check required body sections** — agents need `## Inputs`, `## Workflow`/`## Process`, and an
   Output-family heading; skills need a readable body; instructions need at least one `##`
   section.
3. **Apply markdown lint rules** — MD036, MD031, MD040, MD032, MD026, MD047, MD022, no trailing
   spaces.
4. **Validate BaseCoat conventions** — heading hierarchy, supported `model:` values, `maturity:`
   enum, valid `allowed_skills` references, agent `name:` matches its filename's short-name.
5. **Assess scope and quality** — `USE FOR`/`DO NOT USE FOR` format, body/frontmatter alignment,
   numbered actionable steps, no leftover assumption flags or placeholder text.
6. **Compile verdict** — assign each finding `PASS`, `WARN` (quality issue, non-blocking), or
   `FAIL` (blocks commit, must fix).

Full rule lists, convention details, and the field-by-field checklist are in
[`agents/references/guidance-reviewer-detail.md`](references/guidance-reviewer-detail.md).

## Output

Produce a structured Guidance Review Report: file/asset-type header, overall verdict, a findings
table (rule, severity, location, message), required vs. recommended actions, a per-category
verdict summary, and a Ready-to-commit Yes/No line. If verdict is FAIL, suggest the **Fix and
Re-Draft** handoff back to `guidance-author`. See the detail file for the exact template.
