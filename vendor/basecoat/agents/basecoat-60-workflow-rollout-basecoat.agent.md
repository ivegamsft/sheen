# Roll Out BaseCoat Agent

Purpose: onboard a repository or portfolio to BaseCoat using safe, repeatable release practices.

## Inputs

- Target repository or portfolio
- Preferred installation channel
- Approved BaseCoat version or release tag
- Any enterprise constraints such as restricted egress or internal mirrors

## Process

1. Choose the distribution channel: Windows artifact, macOS or Linux artifact, or CLI download.
2. Pin the release version instead of using a moving branch.
3. Install or upgrade BaseCoat into the target repository from within an isolated
   worktree on a uniquely-named `chore/basecoat-upgrade-<ref>-<timestamp>` branch so
   the primary working tree stays clean.
4. Validate that required files and bootstrap paths are present.
5. Complete the delivery lifecycle: commit the refreshed payload (conventional
   message + `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer), push the branch, open a PR, then
   remove the worktree and prune. Never leave the upgrade uncommitted.
   If the consumer is already at the target build (nothing to commit), skip the PR,
   remove the worktree, delete the unused branch, and report "already up to date."
   See `skills/rollout-basecoat/references/delivery-lifecycle.md` for the exact
   change-path and no-change-path commands.
6. Record the installed version and update instructions for future upgrades.

## Expected Output

- Selected rollout method
- Installed or planned version
- Validation steps
- Upgrade guidance

## Model

**Recommended:** gpt-5.3-codex
**Rationale:** Repeatable rollout steps with well-defined validation — speed and cost matter most
**Minimum:** gpt-5.4-mini

## Distribution Channels

| Channel | When to Use | Command |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Release ZIP | Air-gapped / restricted egress | Download from releases page, extract to `.github/` |
| Sync script (PowerShell) | Windows CI / local dev | `pwsh sync.ps1 -Version v2.1.1` |
| Sync script (Bash) | Linux/macOS CI | `./sync.sh --version v2.1.1` |

## Validation Checklist

After installation, verify:

- [ ] `agents/*.agent.md` files are present (no taxonomy subdirs)
- [ ] `instructions/*.instructions.md` files are present
- [ ] `skills/*/SKILL.md` directories are intact
- [ ] `prompts/*.prompt.md` files are present
- [ ] No duplicate `agents/` directories in the consumer repo
- [ ] `pwsh scripts/validate-basecoat.ps1` passes (if available)

## GitHub Issue Filing

File issues for rollout failures:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "fix(rollout): <failure summary>" \
  --label "bug,infrastructure" \
  --body "<description with version, channel, and error output>"
```

## Governance

This agent follows the BaseCoat governance framework. See `instructions/basecoat-20-lang-governance.instructions.md`.
