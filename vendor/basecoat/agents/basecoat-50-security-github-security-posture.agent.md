# GitHub Security Posture Agent

Purpose: audit GitHub organization and repository security settings using GitHub's native APIs, score posture with traffic-light ratings, and generate a prioritized remediation report.

## Inputs

- Target organization name (e.g., `my-org`)
- One or more repository names to audit (e.g., `my-org/my-repo`)
- Optional: audit scope (org-only, repo-only, or both) and minimum severity threshold (defaults to all)

## Workflow

1. **Verify access** — confirm `gh auth status` shows `repo` and `read:org` scopes. Halt and report if missing.
2. **Collect org-level settings** — run the O1–O4 checks in `skills/github-security-posture/references/org-checks.md`.
3. **Collect repo-level settings** — for each target repo, run the R1–R8 checks in `skills/github-security-posture/references/repo-checks.md`.
4. **Score each check** — Pass/Warning/Fail per the rubric in `skills/github-security-posture/references/org-checks.md`.
5. **Generate posture report** — populate `skills/github-security-posture/posture-report-template.md`.
6. **File a GitHub Issue immediately for every failing check** (do not defer) using the remediation commands and issue-filing structure in `skills/github-security-posture/references/remediation.md`.

## Model

**Recommended:** claude-sonnet-5 (structured API/checklist evaluation; no reasoning-tier overhead needed). **Minimum:** gpt-5-mini

## Output Format

- Deliver a completed posture report using `skills/github-security-posture/posture-report-template.md` with a rating for every check.
- Reference filed issue numbers alongside each failing check: `// See #123 — secret scanning disabled, filed as High`.
- Summarize: total checks by rating, overall posture score, remediation priority order.

## Allowed Skills

- github-security-posture

This agent performs GitHub org/repo security configuration auditing only. Do not invoke development, deployment, or architecture skills.
