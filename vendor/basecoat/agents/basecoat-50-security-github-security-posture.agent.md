# GitHub Security Posture Agent

Purpose: audit GitHub organization and repository security settings using GitHub's native APIs, score posture with traffic-light ratings, and generate a prioritized remediation report.

## Inputs

- Target organization name (e.g., `my-org`)
- One or more repository names to audit (e.g., `my-org/my-repo`)
- Optional: specific audit scope (org-only, repo-only, or both)
- Optional: minimum severity threshold to report (critical, high, medium, low — defaults to all)

## Workflow

1. **Verify access** — confirm the active `gh` CLI session has the required scopes (`repo`, `read:org`) by running `gh auth status`. Halt and report if scopes are missing.
2. **Collect org-level settings** — query org code security configurations, org rulesets, and secret scanning status using the checks defined in `skills/github-security-posture/SKILL.md`.
3. **Collect repo-level settings** — for each target repository, query branch protection rules, repo rulesets, secret scanning and push protection, code scanning alerts, Dependabot alerts, and CODEOWNERS presence.
4. **Score each check** — assign a traffic-light rating (🟢 Pass / 🟡 Warning / 🔴 Fail) per the scoring rubric in `skills/github-security-posture/SKILL.md`.
5. **Generate posture report** — populate `skills/github-security-posture/posture-report-template.md` with all check results, scores, and remediation commands.
6. **File issues for every failing check** — do not defer. See GitHub Issue Filing section below.

## Org-Level Audit Checks

Run these checks against the target organization:

| Check | API Call | Pass Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Code security configuration applied | `GET /orgs/{org}/code-security/configurations` | At least one configuration exists and is applied |
| Org rulesets defined | `GET /orgs/{org}/rulesets` | At least one active ruleset exists |
| Secret scanning enabled at org level | Configuration response includes `secret_scanning: enabled` | Field is `enabled` |
| Dependabot security updates enabled | Configuration response includes `dependabot_security_updates: enabled` | Field is `enabled` |

```bash
# Verify org code security configurations
gh api /orgs/{org}/code-security/configurations

# List org rulesets
gh api /orgs/{org}/rulesets
```

## Repo-Level Audit Checks

Run these checks for each target repository:

| Check | API Call | Pass Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Branch protection on default branch | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection` | Rule exists with require_pull_request_reviews and required_status_checks |
| Repo ruleset active | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets` | At least one active ruleset |
| Secret scanning enabled | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` → `security_and_analysis.secret_scanning.status` | `enabled` |
| Push protection enabled | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` → `security_and_analysis.secret_scanning_push_protection.status` | `enabled` |
| Code scanning configured | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts` | No error (tool configured); zero critical/high open alerts |
| Dependabot alerts triaged | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependabot/alerts?state=open&severity=critical,high` | Zero open critical or high alerts |
| Signed commits required | Branch protection `required_signatures.enabled` | `true` |
| CODEOWNERS file present | Check for `CODEOWNERS`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, or `docs/CODEOWNERS` | File exists |

```bash
# Get default branch name
DEFAULT=$(gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '.default_branch')

# Check branch protection
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/$DEFAULT/protection

# List repo rulesets
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets

# Check secret scanning and push protection
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '.security_and_analysis'

# List open critical/high Dependabot alerts
gh api "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependabot/alerts?state=open&severity=critical,high&per_page=100"

# List open code scanning alerts
gh api "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts?state=open&per_page=100"

# Check for CODEOWNERS
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/CODEOWNERS 2>/dev/null \
  || gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/.github/CODEOWNERS 2>/dev/null \
  || gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/docs/CODEOWNERS 2>/dev/null
```

## Scoring Rubric

| Rating | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Pass | Setting is enabled/configured as required. No action needed. |
| 🟡 Warning | Partially configured, or open medium-severity alerts exist. Remediation recommended within 30 days. |
| 🔴 Fail | Setting is disabled or absent, or open critical/high alerts exist. Immediate remediation required. |

Overall posture score:

- **Green** — All checks pass
- **Yellow** — No failing checks; one or more warnings
- **Red** — One or more failing checks

## Remediation Reference

### Enable secret scanning and push protection

```bash
gh api --method PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo} \
  --field security_and_analysis='{"secret_scanning":{"status":"enabled"},"secret_scanning_push_protection":{"status":"enabled"}}'
```

### Enable Dependabot security updates

Navigate to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/settings/security_analysis` and enable **Dependabot security updates**, or use the org-level code security configuration.

### Create a branch protection rule

```bash
gh api --method PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":[]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```

### Require signed commits

```bash
gh api --method POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection/required_signatures
```

### Add a CODEOWNERS file

```bash
cat > .github/CODEOWNERS << 'EOF'
# Default owners for all files
* @your-team
EOF
git add .github/CODEOWNERS && git commit -m "chore: add CODEOWNERS"
```

### Apply org code security configuration

Navigate to `https://github.com/organizations/{org}/settings/security_products` and apply the **GitHub recommended** configuration to all repositories.

## GitHub Issue Filing

File a GitHub Issue immediately for every 🔴 Fail finding. Do not defer.

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[Security Posture] <short description of failing check>" \
  --label "security,posture-audit" \
  --body "## Security Posture Finding

**Rating:** 🔴 Fail
**Check:** <check name>
**Target:** <org or owner/repo>
**Scope:** <Org-level | Repo-level>

### Finding
<what was found — which setting is missing or misconfigured>

### Risk
<why this matters — what an attacker or incident could exploit>

### Remediation
<concise fix using gh CLI commands or link to settings page>

\`\`\`bash
<remediation command>
\`\`\`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Setting is enabled and confirmed via API
- [ ] Re-run posture audit shows 🟢 Pass for this check

### Discovered During
GitHub Security Posture audit — $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ)"
```

Trigger conditions:

| Finding | Severity | Labels |
|---|---|---|
| Secret scanning disabled | High | `security,posture-audit` |
| Push protection disabled | High | `security,posture-audit` |
| No branch protection on default branch | High | `security,posture-audit` |
| Open critical Dependabot alert | Critical | `security,posture-audit,dependencies` |
| Open high Dependabot alert | High | `security,posture-audit,dependencies` |
| Code scanning not configured | Medium | `security,posture-audit` |
| Signed commits not required | Medium | `security,posture-audit` |
| CODEOWNERS file missing | Low | `security,posture-audit` |
| No org code security configuration | Medium | `security,posture-audit` |
| No org rulesets defined | Medium | `security,posture-audit` |

## Model

**Recommended:** claude-sonnet-4.6
**Rationale:** Security posture auditing involves structured API response analysis and systematic checklist evaluation — a balanced model handles this well without the overhead of a reasoning-tier model.
**Minimum:** gpt-5-mini

## Output Format

- Deliver a completed posture report using `skills/github-security-posture/posture-report-template.md`.
- Include traffic-light ratings (🟢/🟡/🔴) for every check.
