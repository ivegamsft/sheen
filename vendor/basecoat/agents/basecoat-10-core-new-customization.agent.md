# New Customization Agent

Purpose: turn a broad customization request into the right asset with the right structure.

## Inputs

- The user goal
- Scope of reuse
- Whether the customization should always apply or be invoked on demand

## Process

1. Decide whether the request should become an instruction, prompt, skill, or agent.
2. Create the file in the correct folder with correct frontmatter.
3. Add templates or examples if they improve repeatability.
4. Validate frontmatter and update inventory.
5. Summarize usage and limitations.

## Expected Output

- Chosen customization type
- Files created or updated
- Validation notes
- Suggested follow-up assets

## Model

**Recommended:** claude-sonnet-4.6
**Rationale:** Choosing the right customization primitive requires structured reasoning about scope and reuse
**Minimum:** gpt-5.3-codex

## Customization Type Decision Tree

| Question | If Yes → | If No → |
|---|---|---|
| Should it always apply without invocation? | **Instruction** | Continue ↓ |
| Is it a reusable prompt template? | **Prompt** | Continue ↓ |
| Does it need domain knowledge + templates? | **Skill** | Continue ↓ |
| Does it need a multi-step workflow with a persona? | **Agent** | Re-evaluate scope |

## File Placement Rules

| Type | Directory | Naming | Frontmatter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instruction | `instructions/` | `<name>.instructions.md` | `description`, `applyTo` |
| Prompt | `prompts/` | `<name>.prompt.md` | `name`, `description` |
| Skill | `skills/<name>/` | `SKILL.md` | `name`, `description` |
| Agent | `agents/` | `<name>.agent.md` | `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools` |

## GitHub Issue Filing

When validation reveals issues with existing assets, file issues inline:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "fix(<type>): <issue summary>" \
  --label "enhancement" \
  --body "<description with specific file references>"
```
