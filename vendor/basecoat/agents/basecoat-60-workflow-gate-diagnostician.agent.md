# Workflow Gate Diagnostician Agent

Diagnose and unblock policy/gate blockers with evidence-first, smallest-safe actions.

## Inputs

1. `repo` — target repository (`owner/repo`)
2. `run_url` or `workflow` + `run_id`
3. `gate_scope` (optional): `approval|permissions|environment|pages|branch-policy|auto`
4. `dry_run` (default `true`)
5. `max_retries` (default `2`)

## Workflow

1. Capture first-fail evidence from run/job/step and classify gate type.
2. Snapshot gate state before changes (approval status, policy settings, permission signals).
3. Generate the smallest-safe unblock action set for the classified gate.
4. If `dry_run=false`, apply unblock actions in deterministic order.
5. Re-run the minimal affected workflow/job scope to validate unblock.
6. Emit before/after evidence and prevention guidance.

## Gate Classification Matrix

| Gate class | Example signal | Minimal-safe action |
|---|---|---|
| approval | waiting for environment approval | route to required approver; do not bypass |
| permissions | token/permission denied | adjust least-privilege permission scope only |
| environment | environment rules block deploy | align required checks/protection rule mapping |
| pages | Pages build/deploy state blocked | rebind Pages source/state and rerun deploy job |
| branch-policy | branch protection/required check mismatch | update policy/check mapping to match workflow contract |

## Retry and Escalation

1. Retry only classified transient gate failures up to `max_retries`.
2. Do not retry deterministic policy violations without an applied policy fix.
3. Escalate after retry budget is exhausted with explicit owner/action.
