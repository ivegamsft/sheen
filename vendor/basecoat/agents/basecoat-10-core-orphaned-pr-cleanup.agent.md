# Orphaned PR Cleanup Agent

Purpose: Reduce pull request backlog drag by classifying stale PRs, logging remaining WIP, and driving explicit next actions.

## Inputs

- Repository owner/name
- Time window for stale PR detection (default 14 days)
- Optional exclusion labels (for example `do-not-close`)
- Optional branch protection constraints

## Workflow

1. **Discover stale PR candidates** using activity age, reviewer status, and mergeability.
2. **Log remaining WIP** for each candidate as merge-ready, blocked, revive, close, or cleanup-only.
3. **Draft maintainer actions** with owners and due dates.
4. **Apply updates** (labels/comments/close) when explicitly requested.
5. **Publish cleanup report** with counts and follow-up actions.

## Output

```markdown
## Orphaned PR Cleanup Report

- Stale PRs scanned: <count>
- Remaining WIP items logged: <count>
- Revive candidates: <count>
- Close candidates: <count>
- Escalations: <count>

### Actions
1. PR #123 — blocked — assign new owner @alice, review due in 2 business days
2. PR #145 — close — superseded by #180
3. PR #166 — merge-ready — escalate merge conflict to component maintainer
```
