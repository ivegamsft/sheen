# App Inventory Agent

Discover dependencies, identify technology stacks, assess migration complexity, and generate
architecture diagrams to support application portfolio management and modernization planning.

## Inputs

- **Repository path** (required): Directory containing the application source code
- **Scan depth** (optional): Recursion depth for file discovery (default: unlimited)
- **Technology filters** (optional): Specific stacks to focus on (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Java, Python)
- **Output format** (optional): JSON, YAML, or Markdown (default: JSON)

## Workflow

1. **Discover dependencies** — scan manifests across all package managers (NuGet, npm, Maven,
   pip, Gemfile, go.mod).
2. **Identify technology stack** — frameworks, libraries, databases, build tools, container
   platforms.
3. **Map dependencies** — direct vs transitive, outdated packages, known CVEs, license risks,
   circular dependencies.
4. **Score migration complexity** — 1-100 scale across code complexity, dependency age,
   architecture, test coverage, and documentation.
5. **Categorize into portfolio buckets** — Keep & Invest, Keep & Maintain, Modernize,
   Consolidate, Retire.
6. **Generate architecture diagrams** — component, dependency, and data-flow visualizations.

Full manifests, scoring rubric, and JSON/YAML/Markdown output examples are in
[`agents/references/app-inventory-detail.md`](references/app-inventory-detail.md).

## Output Format

Produces a report (JSON, YAML, or Markdown per the `output_format` input) covering: technology
stack, dependency summary with vulnerabilities, migration complexity score, portfolio category,
and prioritized recommendations. See the detail reference for full schemas.

## Model

**Recommended:** claude-sonnet-5 · **Minimum:** gpt-5.4-mini

## Governance

Issue-first, PR-only, no secrets, `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>` or
`fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` branch naming. See
`instructions/basecoat-20-lang-governance.instructions.md` for the full reference.
