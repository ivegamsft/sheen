# App Inventory Agent

The App Inventory Agent performs comprehensive discovery and analysis of legacy applications. It identifies technology stacks, maps dependencies across multiple package managers, assesses migration complexity, and generates architecture diagrams to support application portfolio management and modernization planning.

## Inputs

- **Repository path** (required): Directory containing the application source code
- **Scan depth** (optional): Recursion depth for file discovery (default: unlimited)
- **Technology filters** (optional): Specific stacks to focus on (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Java, Python)
- **Output format** (optional): JSON, YAML, or Markdown (default: JSON)

## Workflow

### 1. Dependency Discovery

The agent scans for dependency manifests across multiple package managers:

```yaml
manifests:
  dotnet:
    - "**/*.csproj"
    - "**/*.fsproj"
    - "**/packages.config"
    - "**/project.json"
  npm:
    - "**/package.json"
    - "**/package-lock.json"
    - "**/yarn.lock"
  maven:
    - "**/pom.xml"
  python:
    - "**/requirements.txt"
    - "**/setup.py"
    - "**/pyproject.toml"
    - "**/Pipfile"
  ruby:
    - "**/Gemfile"
    - "**/Gemfile.lock"
  go:
    - "**/go.mod"
    - "**/go.sum"
```

### 2. Technology Stack Identification

Parse configuration files to identify:

- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core, Express.js, Django, Rails
- **Libraries**: Logging (log4j, NLog, Serilog), ORM (Entity Framework, Hibernate, Sequelize)
- **Databases**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL
- **Build tools**: Maven, Gradle, MSBuild, npm, Webpack, Gulp
- **Container platforms**: Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services

### 3. Dependency Mapping

Build a dependency graph to identify:

```json
{
  "direct_dependencies": 42,
  "transitive_dependencies": 156,
  "outdated_packages": 8,
  "security_vulnerabilities": 3,
  "license_risks": 2
}
```

- Direct vs transitive dependencies
- Version constraints and range specifications
- Outdated package versions
- Known security vulnerabilities
- License compatibility issues
- Circular dependencies

### 4. Migration Complexity Scoring

Assess migration readiness based on:

- **Code complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity, code density, patterns used
- **Dependency age**: Average package age, deprecation status
- **Architecture**: Monolithic vs microservices, coupling analysis
- **Test coverage**: Unit test ratios, integration test presence
- **Documentation**: README quality, inline documentation
- **Build times**: Current build performance metrics
- **External dependencies**: Cloud provider lock-in, proprietary integrations

Complexity scores range from 1-100:

```text
1-20:   Low complexity (quick modernization)
21-40:  Moderate complexity (planned migration)
41-60:  High complexity (significant refactoring required)
61-80:  Very high complexity (phased approach needed)
81-100: Critical complexity (major rewrite or replacement)
```

### 5. Portfolio Categorization

Classify applications into strategic categories:

```text
Keep & Invest:    Modern architecture, active maintenance, strategic value
Keep & Maintain:  Stable, working applications, minimal changes
Modernize:        Legacy but valuable, benefits from technology update
Consolidate:      Duplicate functionality, candidate for consolidation
Retire:           Obsolete, low usage, can be replaced
```

### 6. Architecture Diagram Generation

Create visual representations of application architecture:

```text
- Component diagrams (services, modules, layers)
- Dependency diagrams (external integrations, APIs)
- Data flow diagrams (input/output, database connections)
- Technology stack visualizations
```
