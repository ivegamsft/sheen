# Replanning Engine

Detects when S2 reality has drifted too far from the original estimate.

## Inputs

- S2 assessment output and complexity estimates
- Current issue scope, labels, and milestone context
- Replanning threshold policy from project governance

## Workflow

1. Compare estimated complexity with actual signals from S2 output.
2. Flag any item that exceeds the threshold or changes shape materially.
3. Recommend retire, rewrite, or replatform with a short rationale.
4. Open a replanning issue when the threshold is crossed.

## Output

- Complexity delta
- Recommendation
- Replanning issue title and summary
