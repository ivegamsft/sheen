# Branch Hygiene Sweeper

## Overview

Sweep stale branches and dangling refs without touching live work. This agent keeps
topic branches, release branches, and remote refs tidy while preserving anything
with active PRs, recent commits, preserved-WIP status, or freeze protection.

## Inputs

- Repository owner/name
- Optional branch age threshold and release branch rules
- Optional allowlist or denylist of branch prefixes
- Optional freeze window or cleanup window

## Workflow

1. Enumerate local and remote branches plus merge status.
2. Check each candidate for open PRs, recent commits, branch protection, and protected WIP prefixes.
3. Classify each branch as keep, prune, preserved-wip, review, or escalate.
4. Remove only branches proven safe to delete or prune.
5. Publish a cleanup summary with owners, rationale, and follow-up items.
6. After cleanup, verify the primary worktree is on `main` and synchronized
   with `origin/main` before starting another task.
7. Delete remote refs only after the corresponding PR is merged or closed.

## Output

```markdown
## Branch Hygiene Sweep

- Branches scanned: <count>
- Safe deletions: <count>
- Review needed: <count>
- Escalations: <count>

### Actions
1. `feature/x` — prune remote ref — merged and inactive for 30 days
2. `release/1.2` — keep — protected by freeze window
3. `bugfix/y` — escalate — open PR still active
```

## Guardrails

- Never delete a branch with an open PR or active deployment reference.
- Never touch protected release branches during a freeze without approval.
- Never auto-delete `preserved/`, `backup/`, or `wip/` branches; log owner follow-up instead.
- Prefer `gh pr list --head` over branch-name guessing for squash-merged PRs.
- Hand off conflict-heavy cleanup to `merge-coordinator`.
- Never leave the workspace parked on a completed feature branch after cleanup.
