# Naming Standards

Use this instruction when a change introduces new files, modules, packages, classes, functions, resources, or environments.

## General Conventions

- Repositories, folders, and reusable package names: `kebab-case`
- Markdown, YAML, JSON, shell, and script files: `kebab-case`
- Types, classes, and exported models: `PascalCase`
- Variables, functions, and parameters: `camelCase`
- Constants: follow language conventions, but keep names descriptive rather than abbreviated
- Test names: describe behavior and expected outcome, not only the method under test

## Infrastructure Conventions

- Environment markers should be explicit: `dev`, `test`, `stage`, `prod`
- Azure resource names should be deterministic, policy-compliant, and as short as practical
- Prefer a stable pattern such as `<org>-<workload>-<env>-<region>-<suffix>` where the platform allows it
- Keep tags aligned with naming so ownership and cost reporting stay consistent

## BaseCoat Asset Naming

- New agent and instruction files use a stable prefix: `basecoat-<band>-<area>-<topic>.agent.md` and `basecoat-<band>-<area>-<topic>.instructions.md`
- `band` is a two-digit grouping prefix, `area` is the taxonomy token, and `topic` is the kebab-case slug
- Keep the filename, catalog entry, and documentation reference aligned in the same change
- During migration, preserve compatibility by updating aliases, references, and scripts together; do not leave mixed old/new names in active catalogs
- For existing assets, prefer a staged rename with a compatibility note rather than a partial rename that breaks discoverability

## Workflow Naming Conventions

- Workflow filenames remain stable in `kebab-case` with optional `.lock` suffix: `<workflow>.yml` or `<workflow>.lock.yml`
- Workflow display names in YAML must start with `BaseCoat -` to make ownership explicit in GitHub Actions views
- Use pattern: `name: "BaseCoat - <workflow purpose>"`
- Apply this convention to new and existing workflows without renaming files unless a migration plan explicitly requires it

## Instruction Alias Exceptions

- Canonical instruction files must use `basecoat-<band>-<area>-<topic>.instructions.md`.
- Non-prefixed instruction filenames are allowed only as legacy compatibility aliases.
- Compatibility alias files must include:
  - `compatibilityAlias: true`
  - `canonicalInstruction: "<basecoat-...instructions.md>"`
  - A description starting with `BaseCoat compatibility alias`.
- Approved legacy alias filenames:
  - `architecture.instructions.md`
  - `documentation.instructions.md`
  - `observability.instructions.md`
  - `security.instructions.md`
  - `ux.instructions.md`
  - `intent-routing.instructions.md`
  - `governance.instructions.md`
  - `plan-first.instructions.md`
  - `ci-firewall.instructions.md`
  - `rbac-authentication.instructions.md`

## Review Lens

- Does the new name convey purpose without local tribal knowledge?
- Is the name consistent with adjacent code and infrastructure?
- Will the name age well as the component grows beyond its first use case?
