# Mutation Testing Standards

## When to Apply

Use mutation testing when:

- Test suite has ≥80% line coverage but you want to verify it catches real bugs.
- Validating critical system behavior before production release.
- Investigating false confidence (low failure rate, but bugs still ship).

**Key insight:** Line coverage is a poor proxy for test quality. A test that executes a line but never asserts the result is worthless. Mutation testing exposes this gap.

## How It Works

1. Tool introduces deliberate bugs (mutations: operator swap, condition delete, return value flip).
2. Full test suite runs against each mutation.
3. **Killed** = tests caught the bug (good). **Survived** = tests missed it (gap).
4. `Mutation Score = killed / total × 100`. Target: **>80%**, aim for **>85%**.

## Quick Rules

- Score **>85%** — production-ready; monitor on CI.
- Score **70–85%** — acceptable; plan fixes in next sprint.
- Score **<70%** — halt feature development; remediate first.
- Always test at **exact boundaries** (18 vs 17/19) to catch `>=` vs `>` mutations.
- Always test **invalid inputs** to catch return-value mutations.
- Always test **guard conditions** (auth, validation) to catch conditional-deletion mutations.
- Group survived mutations by category before fixing; don't fix one-off survivors at random.
