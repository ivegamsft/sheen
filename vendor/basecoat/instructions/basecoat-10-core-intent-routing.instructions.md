# Intent Prefix Routing

The user communicates intent through structured prefixes. Parse the prefix
before any plain-text interpretation.

## Enforcement Contract

Prefix parsing is a hard contract, not a soft hint. When a recognized prefix
appears at the start of a message, it must be interpreted as an authoritative
routing signal before any plain-text interpretation occurs.

Rules:

1. Parse the prefix first.
2. A recognized prefix overrides any other reading of the request.
3. `bug:` routes immediately to the defect workflow.
4. `feature:` routes immediately to the implementation/design workflow.
5. Any agent or pipeline that ignores a recognized prefix is in violation of
   this contract.
6. Before any implementation begins for a recognized implementation prefix
   (`bug:`, `feature:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `deploy:`), the
   LOG-FIRST gate in `governance.instructions.md` must be satisfied.

## Syntax Determines Timing

The same prefix has different timing implications depending on context.

### Standalone message — act now

When a prefix appears as the first word of a standalone message, treat it as
immediate work.

### Bulleted list — triage and log, not implement

When prefixes appear as items in a bulleted list, they are triage items, not
immediate work orders. Log them and confirm receipt.

### Mixed message — respect both

A message can contain both an immediate preamble and a triage list. The
preamble may be immediate; the list items remain triage.

## Timing Modifiers

These words override the default timing of a prefix:

| Modifier | Effect |
|---|---|
| `now`, `immediately`, `urgent` | Promote any prefix to immediate action |
| `later`, `backlog`, `next sprint` | Defer any prefix, even `bug:` |
| `no changes`, `read-only`, `analysis only` | Suppress implementation even for `bug:` |
| `log it`, `file an issue` | Log only; do not implement |
| `just document` | Documentation output only; no code changes |

## Optimize Routing (`optimize:`)

`optimize:` is an advisory-first prefix that packetizes a composite request into a
bounded execution contract before running side effects.

Execution contract:

1. Parse scope into one or more explicit objectives.
2. Emit a normalized execution packet with:
   - scope boundaries
   - stop conditions
   - measurable done criteria
   - validation clauses
   - routing hints (agent/skill or direct workflow path)
3. If `advisory-only` is present, stop after emitting the packet.
4. If execution is requested, run the packet in order and report cycle summaries.
5. When `optimize:` wraps `ship-it` or `rca`, preserve those governance gates and
   do not downgrade required checks.

## Audit Mode (`audit:`)

`audit:` is always read-only unless the user explicitly says "and fix" or
"resolve."

## Fleet Routing

`fleet:` is the shortcut intent for a sprint-execution batch that combines
closeout, planning, oldest-first issue triage, PR/build auditing, and branch
cleanup. It must start with the parallel-session coordinator and a latest-main
sync preflight before fan-out.

Execution contract:

1. Start with `@parallel-session-coordinator`.
2. Confirm latest-main sync before any write-capable lane starts.
3. Fan out to the sprint closeout, triage, build audit, planning, and hygiene
   agents only after preflight is recorded.

## Fleet Persistent Control-Loop Mode

When a user repeats wave-continuation phrasing (for example, "plan and execute
the next wave", "execute the next wave", or "continue the ship-it loop"),
route the execution step to the persistent control-loop contract instead of
restarting broad sprint planning each turn.

Execution contract:

1. Normalize to `fleet:` intent and start from `@parallel-session-coordinator`
   preflight.
2. Run bounded cycle execution with `ship-it-control-loop` semantics
   (`max_cycles`, `max_retries`, `dry_run`).
3. Emit a cycle checkpoint from active `/tasks`, in-scope PR state, and
   required-check status each cycle.
4. Continue only while stop conditions are not met and convergence is viable.
5. Stop on completion, blocking dependency/policy gate, max-cycle exhaustion,
   or explicit manual stop.

## Backlog Autopilot Routing (`autopilot:`)

`autopilot:` is a continuous backlog-delivery intent. It burns the issue backlog
oldest to newest in dependency-ordered waves and runs unattended until stopped
or blocked. It is a thin orchestration layer over existing assets and must not
reimplement their behavior. It runs standalone (`concurrency=1`) or as a fleet
(`concurrency=N`). See `docs/design/backlog-autopilot-intent.md`.

Relationship to neighboring intents:

- `fleet:` is sprint-boundary scoped (closeout, plan, cleanup) and runs once.
- `wave:` is a single dependency-ordered batch, with no continuing loop.
- `autopilot:` is the continuing multi-wave loop that composes both, plus the
  ship-it control loop and delivery-autopilot, plus deploy to final destination.

Execution contract:

1. Start with `@backlog-autopilot`. For fleet mode, start from
   `@parallel-session-coordinator` preflight and confirm latest-main sync before
   any write-capable lane starts.
2. Select the oldest N open, actionable issues via `backlog-burndown` and
   `@issue-triage`; exclude blocked or needs-info items. Build the next wave by
   topological sort using `scripts/backlog-autopilot/build-waves.ps1`.
3. For each item run the phase gates in order: design and debate
   (`@solution-architect` plus the `design-debate` format), scope
   (`@task-scope-validator`), positive-and-negative tests
   (`@strategy-to-automation`), implement, commit, push, and PR.
4. Land PRs via the GitHub-native merge queue. Autopilot lanes run under
   `merge_queue_posture: required` so `pr-auto-merge-executor` defers to the
   queue and merges stay serialized and conflict-free.
5. Pace with `scripts/backlog-autopilot/pace-gate.ps1`: enforce a minimum
   interval between merges and exponential backoff on `403`, `429`, and
   secondary-rate-limit responses.
6. Monitor for blocks and broken builds (`@self-healing-ci`,
   `@broken-build-troubleshooter`, `automation-stuck-state-watchdog`); retry
   within `max_retries`, else escalate and mark blocked.
7. Deploy to final destination via `post-merge-release-chain` and
   `publish-to-production`, gated by the ship-it release gate.
8. Emit a per-cycle checkpoint using `ship-it-control-loop` semantics
   (`max_cycles`, `max_retries`, `dry_run`, `stop_conditions`) and advance to
   the next wave. Stop on empty backlog, blocking dependency or policy gate,
   max-cycle exhaustion, repeated deploy-gate failure, or manual stop.

## GitHub-Native Routing

GitHub-native prefixes are deterministic and should avoid extra disambiguation
turns when the request already names a GitHub artifact.
Deterministic guardrail order: `workflow:` `actions:` `pr:` `issue:` `portfolio:` `release:`.

Execution contracts:

1. `workflow:` and `actions:` go straight to failed-run evidence first (run,
   job, failing step), then apply a minimal fix, then rerun the affected scope.
2. `pr:` routes to PR-first lifecycle triage (remaining WIP log, mergeability,
   stale ownership, review blockers) before any broad repo analysis.
3. `issue:` routes to issue quality/label/backlog triage first.
4. `portfolio:` routes to issue/PR hygiene and grouping workflow first: dedupe,
   categorize, wire dependencies, cluster by feature, then ensure a canonical
   sprint/project link is captured in repo docs.
5. `release:` routes to release workflow (version source, changelog, tag/release
   operations) first.

## Version Routing

`version:` is deterministic and should not trigger follow-up disambiguation when
the request already names BaseCoat/downstream version checks.

Execution contract:

1. Read downstream installed version from `.github/base-coat/version.json` when present.
2. Determine install origin:
   - Published BaseCoat source (release/tag or synced `.github/base-coat` payload)
   - Non-published/manual/local customization source
3. If origin is published BaseCoat, fetch latest published BaseCoat release and report drift (`installed` vs `latest`).
4. If origin is not published BaseCoat, report installed version and state that latest published comparison is not authoritative for that source.

## PR Lifecycle Modifier

`pr-lifecycle=<none|standard|full>` is a supported lifecycle modifier for
`feature:` and `pr:` work.

Execution contract:

1. Keep the recognized prefix (`feature:` or `pr:`) as the authoritative routing
   trigger.
2. Parse `pr-lifecycle=<none|standard|full>` as a first-class modifier when
   present.
3. For `feature:` requests, if PR language is present but `pr-lifecycle` is
   omitted, default to `pr-lifecycle=standard`.
4. For `feature:` requests without PR language and without `pr-lifecycle`, do
   not infer lifecycle mode.
5. Reject invalid `pr-lifecycle` values and return explicit guidance listing
   allowed values.
6. Reject dual-prefix combinations (for example `feature: pr:`) and require a
   single authoritative prefix.
7. When `pr-lifecycle=full` is selected, expand routing to full lifecycle
   coverage: remaining WIP logging, merge-readiness triage, broken-build
   follow-up, closure evidence, and post-merge branch hygiene.
8. Keep branch cleanup subordinate to PR state: only merged or explicitly
   closed work moves into branch-hygiene actions.
9. In `pr-lifecycle=full` mode, do not mark the request complete while WIP
   tasks or uncommitted changes remain unresolved.

## Plan-First Enforcement

For any implementation intent that touches multiple files or requires design
decisions, planning is required before execution begins.

Affected prefixes: `feature:`, `refactor:`, `architect:`

When a standalone `feature:`, `refactor:`, or `architect:` message would
produce multi-file changes or architectural decisions:

1. Emit a plan covering scope, approach, risks, and verification criteria.
2. Present the plan to the user.
3. Do not begin implementing until the plan is confirmed or explicitly waived.

See `instructions/basecoat-10-core-plan-first.instructions.md` for the compatibility alias used
during the rollout.

## Sprint-Style Request Nudge

When the user asks to plan and execute the next sprint or use similar
sprint-planning language:

1. Route to `@sprint-planner` first.
2. Present the sprint plan and wait for confirmation.
3. Only then begin execution with the oldest actionable item.

## Azure Preflight Guardrail

For `azure:` and `infra:` work, review these compatibility aliases before
proceeding:

- `instructions/basecoat-60-workflow-ci-firewall.instructions.md`
- `instructions/basecoat-50-security-rbac-authentication.instructions.md`

These files preserve the legacy names while the prefixed BaseCoat instruction
files remain the canonical source.

## Term Disambiguation and Aliases

Normalize these bare terms and phrases to an intent before plain-text
interpretation.

### Design terms (UI vs UX vs IA)

`ui`, `ux`, and `ia` are distinct disciplines and must not collapse to one route.

| Term | Discipline | Normalized intent | Route to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ui` | User interface — components, layout, visual and interaction implementation | `ui:` | `@frontend-dev`, `@ux-designer` |
| `ux` | User experience — flows, usability, journeys, interaction design | `ux:` | `@ux-designer`, `@frontend-dev` |
| `ia` | Information architecture — content structure, navigation, taxonomy, sitemap | `ia:` | `@ux-designer`, `@tech-writer` |

### Error and failure terms (noun-keyed)

`error`, `fail`, and `failing` are overloaded. Route on the subject noun, not
the word itself.

| Subject of the error/failure | Normalized intent | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| A running service, site, or app is down | `outage:` | `@rca`, `@incident-responder` |
| A GitHub Actions workflow run, job, or CI step | `workflow:` | `@broken-build-troubleshooter`, `@self-healing-ci` |
| Application code or a test defect | `bug:` | `@code-review`, `@self-healing-ci` |
| Repeated or unknown failure needing diagnosis first | `rca:` | `@rca`, `@config-auditor` |

When the subject noun is absent or ambiguous, ask one disambiguation question
before acting. The `outage:` aliases (`broke`, `broken`, `down`, `dead`,
`site down`, `not responding`, `incident`) apply only when the subject is a
running service, site, or app; application code or test defects route to `bug:`
and GitHub Actions workflow/CI failures route to `workflow:`.

### Work-in-progress and cleanup

| Term or phrase | Normalized intent | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| `wip` | `pr:` (remaining WIP logging / merge-readiness) | `@orphaned-pr-cleanup` |
| `backlog wip` | `issue:` (backlog WIP triage) | `@issue-triage` |
| `clean up branches` / `stale branches` | `chore:` | `@branch-hygiene-sweeper` |
| `clean up worktrees` / `clean up work trees` / `prune worktrees` | `chore:` | `@branch-hygiene-sweeper` + `git-worktrees` skill |
| `finish this lane` / `close out this branch` / `return to main` | `pr:` | `lane-closeout` skill |

Branch cleanup routes to `@branch-hygiene-sweeper`; worktree cleanup additionally
uses the `git-worktrees` skill (`skills/git-worktrees/SKILL.md`), which owns the
stale-worktree pruning workflow and its safety checks.

Lane finish requests route first to `skills/lane-closeout/SKILL.md`. It owns
dirty-WIP capture, sync/publish, PR create-or-update, terminal-state
classification, and safe handoff to branch/worktree cleanup primitives.

`wip/`, `preserved/`, and `backup/` branches are retained (never auto-pruned)
and logged with an owner and next action. Never remove a worktree that has
uncommitted changes or one an active agent is using.

Session/worktree-end automation uses lane-closeout `safe` mode: capture, push,
and report only, with no rebase, merge, PR close, branch deletion, or worktree
removal.

### Backlog and sprint execution

| Phrase | Normalized intent | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| `burn down the backlog` / `backlog burndown` / `burndown` | backlog-burndown skill | `@issue-triage`, `@orphaned-pr-cleanup`, `@sprint-planner` |
| `plan sprint` / `execute sprint` / `sprint` | `sprint:` | `@sprint-planner` |
| `close sprint` / `sprint closeout` / `sprint retro` | `sprint:` | `@sprint-closeout-auditor` |
| `wave` | `wave:` | `@sprint-planner`, `@parallel-session-coordinator` |
| `burn the backlog` / `work the backlog` / `backlog autopilot` / `continuous delivery loop` | `autopilot:` | `@backlog-autopilot`, `@ship-it-control-loop`, `@delivery-autopilot` |

Burn-down and wave execution include open PRs, not just issues. Decomposition
hierarchy: **sprint -> wave -> issue -> task**.

## Routing Notes

- Use `instructions/basecoat-10-core-plan-first.instructions.md` when a request asks to plan
  before execution.
- Use the Azure preflight aliases before any Azure provisioning or RBAC-sensitive
  changes.
- Keep the canonical prefixed files and the compatibility aliases in sync during
  migration.

## Chronicle Routing (`chronicle:`)

`chronicle:` is for converting execution history into durable narrative artifacts.

Execution contract:

1. Generate a markdown story/update packet from session history references.
2. Support append and update behavior for target story documents.
3. Emit issue-ready learnings for follow-up tracking.
4. When requested, produce memory-promotion suggestions with dedupe checks.
