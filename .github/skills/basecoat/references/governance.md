## Machine-Readable Registry

`basecoat-metadata.json` at the repository root contains the machine-readable registry of
all agents: names, descriptions, file paths, category groupings, keywords, aliases, and
paired skill references. Use it for programmatic matching when keyword lookup alone is
insufficient.

## Router Governance

- Maintain keyword uniqueness — no keyword should map to more than one agent.
- When adding a new agent, add its keywords to this table and `basecoat-metadata.json`.
- Run `pwsh tests/run-tests.ps1` to validate structure after changes.
- The router must not modify agent files — it reads and delegates only.
