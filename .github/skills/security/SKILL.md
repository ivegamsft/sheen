# Security Skill

Audit code for security vulnerabilities, model threats, review dependencies for known CVEs, and enforce secure coding standards.

## Templates in This Skill

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `owasp-checklist.md` | OWASP Top 10 evaluation checklist with pass/fail tracking per category |
| `stride-threat-model-template.md` | STRIDE threat modeling template for enumerating and rating threats per component |
| `vulnerability-report-template.md` | Structured vulnerability report for compiling all findings with severity ratings |
| `dependency-audit-template.md` | Dependency audit template for documenting CVEs, affected packages, and remediation |

## Agent Pairing

Use with `security-analyst` agent. For backend security pair with `backend-dev`; for frontend security (CSP, XSS, CORS) pair with `frontend-dev`.
