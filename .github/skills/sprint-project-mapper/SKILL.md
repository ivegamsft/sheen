# Sprint/Project Mapper Skill

Map issues/PRs into meaningful sprint or project groups for planning, reporting, and release notes.

## Use Cases

- Cluster items with similar tags (`sprint:*`, `wave:*`, `project:*`, `area/*`) into coherent project groups.
- Debate whether groups should be split or merged before metric reporting.
- Compute quality metrics: issues, PRs, LOC delta, cycle time, closure ratio, blocker density.
- Generate release-note-ready summaries only for groups that pass significance thresholds.
- Audit and remediate missing `sprint:*` / `wave:*` labels on merged PRs before release-note cut.

## Group Significance (Default)

A group is meaningful if it satisfies at least one breadth threshold and one activity threshold:

- Breadth: `issues >= 5` OR `merged_prs >= 3`
- Activity: `loc_changed >= 200` OR `activity_span_days >= 7` OR explicit sprint/milestone tag

Groups failing thresholds are merged into nearest valid group when similarity >0.65, else reported as residual.

Release-note output requires at least one linked merged PR; significant groups without linked PRs are reported under linkage-gap audit.

## Label Hygiene Protection

To protect release-note consistency, run a label hygiene pass before mapping output is finalized:

1. Detect merged PRs in scope missing both `sprint:*` and `wave:*`.
2. Report the missing-label list with PR numbers and owners.
3. Block "final" grouping output until each PR has a label or an explicit waiver note.

### Label hygiene command

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --limit 200 --json number,title,author,labels \
  | jq '[.[] | select((.labels | map(.name | test("^sprint:|^wave:")) | any) | not)]'
```
