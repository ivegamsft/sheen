# Handoff Skill

Transfer work cleanly when a session ends or context rotates — so another agent or future session can resume without losing reasoning or state.

## Two-Layer Approach

A good handoff captures both layers:

- **Semantic summary** — what the task was, why decisions were made, what failed, what tradeoffs matter.
- **Mechanical state** — exact file paths, commands run, validations completed, blockers, and concrete next steps.

## Templates in This Skill

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `handoff-template.md` | Session handoff covering status, completed work, failed approaches, decisions, dependencies, files modified, and commands run |
