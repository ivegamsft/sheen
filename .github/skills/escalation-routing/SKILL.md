# Escalation Routing Skill

Use this skill to package high-risk decisions for human approval with a durable trail in GitHub.

## Reference Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`references/approval-packet-template.md`](references/approval-packet-template.md) | Structured decision packet and PR-comment approval template |

## When to Route

Route the decision when the work is:

- High-risk, irreversible, or compliance-sensitive
- Ambiguous enough that a human must choose between valid options
- A PR that needs explicit sign-off before merge or release
- A change that needs a traceable approval record in GitHub

## Expected Output

Return two artifacts:

1. A structured approval packet with the risk, recommendation, approver, and options
2. A PR-comment approval request that a human can answer in-thread
