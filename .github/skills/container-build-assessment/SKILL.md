# Container Build Assessment

This skill runs four scripts in order to produce a structured container build assessment.

## Usage

Run all steps:

```powershell
./scripts/orchestrate-skill-scripts.ps1 `
  -SkillPath skills/container-build-assessment/SKILL.md `
  -DockerfilePath ./Dockerfile `
  -AppRoot .
```

Run one step:

```powershell
./scripts/orchestrate-skill-scripts.ps1 `
  -SkillPath skills/container-build-assessment/SKILL.md `
  -Step analyze-dockerfile `
  -DockerfilePath ./Dockerfile
```

## Output

The orchestrator returns step-by-step JSON plus a final consolidated result.
