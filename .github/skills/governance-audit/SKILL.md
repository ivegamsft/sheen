# Governance Audit Skill

Use this skill to audit the repo against the canonical governance contract.

## When to Use

- Checking issue and PR labels against the canonical taxonomy
- Looking for missing or stale governance docs
- Auditing issue and PR templates for stale references
- Reviewing workflows that should enforce metadata rules
- Preparing follow-up issues for uncovered gaps

## Workflow

1. Compare the live repo state to the canonical governance guide.
2. Identify missing docs, stale labels, and template drift.
3. Separate true gaps from repo-specific exceptions.
4. Export governance-control state for branch, checks, environments, queue, runners, and production dispatch permissions.
5. Summarize findings with severity and evidence.
6. File or propose GitHub issues for the unresolved gaps.

## Mandatory exports

Every governance audit must include exported evidence for:

- Branch protection configuration
- Required status checks
- Environment protection rules
- Merge queue configuration
- Runner group permissions
- Who can dispatch production workflows

## Output

- Findings table
- Gap list
- Recommended follow-up issues
- Control export package for audit traceability
