# BOM Schema Skill

Define and validate bill-of-materials schemas with stable field names and predictable resource identifiers.

## Templates in This Skill

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bom-schema-template.json` | JSON Schema starter for BOM validation rules, required fields, and naming constraints |

## Core Rules

- Validate required fields before downstream processing.
- Keep resource identifiers in a single documented format.
- Enforce naming conventions consistently across every row or item.
- Prefer explicit schema rules over free-form notes.

## Agent Pairing

Use with agents that ingest BOMs, validate structured inventory data, or generate machine-readable contract files.
