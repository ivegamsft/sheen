# Release Audit Skill

Review release candidates for versioning, changelog quality, tagging, and publish completeness.

## USE FOR

- Auditing a release PR before merge
- Checking semver bumps against merged work
- Verifying changelog entries, release notes, and tag naming
- Confirming the release package or publish step is complete

## DO NOT USE FOR

- Cutting or publishing the release
- Planning sprint work or backlogs
- Debugging unrelated product defects
- Deployment troubleshooting after a release is live

## Workflow

1. Confirm the version bump matches the merged work.
2. Check changelog coverage, grouping, and link quality.
3. Verify tags, release notes, and artifact references.
4. Validate release-note source labeling: merged PRs should carry `wave:*` or `sprint:*`.
5. Review rollback notes and publish completeness.
6. Report any missing release prerequisites with evidence.

## Wave/Sprint Label Gate

When release notes are expected to be grouped by wave/sprint:

- Treat missing `wave:*` and `sprint:*` labels as a release-audit finding.
- Severity defaults to `major`; escalate to `block` if >10% of in-scope merged PRs are unlabeled.
- Recommend remediation via `sprint-project-mapper` label hygiene pass and rerun of `release-notes`.

## Output

Return:

- Release verdict: ready, ready with notes, or block
- Findings with severity and evidence
- Missing release checklist items
- Suggested fix or follow-up action
