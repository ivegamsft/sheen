# Sprint Retrospective Skill

Knowledge pack for the `@sprint-retrospective` agent — templates, metrics formulas, and a tips taxonomy for generating structured retrospective documents.

## Reference Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| [`references/template-formulas.md`](references/template-formulas.md) | Retrospective document template, metrics formulas, tips taxonomy, GitHub API queries |

## Key Metrics (Quick Reference)

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Time-to-merge | `PR merged_at − PR created_at` (exclude draft time) |
| Parallel dispatch ratio | `max concurrent open PRs / total PRs` |
| Velocity | `issues closed / calendar days` |
| Churn rate | `lines removed / lines added` — high churn signals rework |
