# Merge Conflict Mediator Skill

Use this skill to standardize conflict resolution decisions before `merge-coordinator`
applies them. It is intentionally conservative: if the policy is unclear, escalate.

## Inputs

- Conflict list and file paths
- Merge policy or precedence rule
- File type context (docs, config, manifest, lockfile, source)
- Optional branch freeze or release window context

## Workflow

1. Classify each conflicted file by type and risk.
2. Apply a deterministic resolution rule for low-risk file types.
3. Regenerate lockfiles or manifests only when the root inputs are known-good.
4. Escalate source-code conflicts and ambiguous merges to a human.
5. Produce a file-by-file conflict playbook for `merge-coordinator`.

## Output

```markdown
## Conflict Playbook

| File | Type | Policy | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| README.md | docs | merge unique sections | auto-resolve |
| package-lock.json | lockfile | regenerate from root manifest | auto-resolve |
| src/app.ts | source | manual review | escalate |
```

## Guardrails

- Never silently discard dependency changes.
- Never auto-resolve source code or generated code without a policy.
- Preserve both sides of docs/config changes whenever possible.
- Escalate if the policy would violate a freeze or branch gate.
