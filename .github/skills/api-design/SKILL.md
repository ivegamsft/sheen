# API Design Skill

Design new API contracts, review spec changes for breaking changes, choose versioning strategies, and enforce API governance standards.

## Templates in This Skill

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openapi-template.md` | OpenAPI 3.x skeleton for a new REST API resource with CRUD, pagination, and error envelopes |
| `breaking-change-checklist.md` | Checklist for evaluating whether a spec change is breaking, with mitigation guidance |
| `versioning-decision-tree.md` | Decision tree for choosing the right versioning action for a given change |
| `api-governance-checklist.md` | Governance checklist every API spec must pass before approval |

## Agent Pairing

Use with `api-designer` agent. For implementation hand off to `backend-dev`; for data models coordinate with `data-tier`; share the spec with `frontend-dev` for consumer integration.
