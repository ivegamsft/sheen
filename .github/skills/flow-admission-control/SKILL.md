# Flow Admission Control Skill

Use this skill to keep repository flow stable by controlling how much work enters
review and merge paths relative to available capacity.

## When to Use

- Defining max open-PR, reviewer, and queue-depth limits
- Creating merge-ready admission criteria and priority lanes
- Setting stale/conflict auto-rebase and regeneration policy
- Designing load-shedding and fairness behavior during spikes

## Workflow

1. Assess intake pressure versus reviewer and CI capacity.
2. Define quantitative WIP and queue limits by stage.
3. Set admission rules and priority policy.
4. Define stale/conflict remediation timers and actions.
5. Publish enforcement and escalation playbook.

## Output

- Admission and WIP policy matrix
- Stale/conflict lifecycle rules
- Escalation and load-shedding guidance
