USE FOR: plan legacy app modernization strategy, choose rewrite versus refactor versus replace, design strangler fig migration, sequence service extraction by dependency risk, decide database-first or UI-first migration. DO NOT USE FOR: greenfield system design, minor bug fixes in one service, container-only deployment setup."

# Cross-Stack Modernization

Language-agnostic patterns for incrementally modernizing legacy applications: strangler fig,
anti-corruption layer (ACL), risk scoring, and dependency extraction sequencing.

## Strategy Decision (Quick Reference)

| Criterion | Refactor | Strangler fig | Full rewrite |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Test coverage | > 60 % | 30–60 % | < 30 % |
| Time horizon | Weeks | Months | Quarters |
| Risk tolerance | Low | Medium | High |
