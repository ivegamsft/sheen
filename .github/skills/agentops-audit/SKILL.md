# Agent Operations Audit Skill

Audit agent or skill specifications and produce an actionable scorecard, risk list, and revised spec.

## USE FOR

- Scoring existing specs using a 0-5 rubric
- Finding ambiguity, safety gaps, and tool-policy issues
- Recommending concrete, prioritized fixes
- Producing a revised spec with measurable success criteria
- Generating routing rationale and estimated turn profile
- Auditing model IDs and reasoning-effort compatibility against the generated capability catalog
- Supporting `audit` and `create_and_audit` flows in `agent-designer`

## DO NOT USE FOR

- Writing product application code
- Infrastructure deployment and operations
- General-purpose code review outside agent/skill definitions

## Required Scoring Dimensions (0-5)

- `clarity`
- `safety_compliance`
- `tool_correctness`
- `ambiguity_handling`
- `cost_latency_fit`
- `eval_readiness`

## Audit Deliverables

- `scorecard`
- `risks`
- `concrete_fixes`
- `revised_spec`

## Output Contract

Always include:

1. **Task-shaping classification** (`execution_mode`, `estimated_turns`, `tool_profile`, `uncertainty`)
2. **Routing profile**:
   - `recommended_class`: `Fast | Balanced | Deep | Tool-Strict`
   - `rationale`
   - `estimated_turns`: `1 | 2-3 | 4+`
   - `risk_mitigations`
3. **Artifacts**:
   - `audit_report`
   - `agent_spec` when a revised or regenerated spec is produced

## Guardrails

- Do not assume model family names are portable across providers.
- Prefer measurable success criteria over subjective language.
- Escalate when constraints conflict (for example: fast + deep reasoning + lowest cost).
- Read `docs/reference/model-capabilities.json` before recommending a model.
- Treat `reasoning_depth` as task metadata; do not emit `reasoning_effort` unless
  the selected model advertises configurable reasoning.
- Report unknown model IDs and fixed-effort models separately. Effective
  organization and user entitlement remains a runtime check.
