# Session Analysis Skill

Analyze a Copilot CLI session to answer operational questions about tool usage, tokens, model routing, and turn cadence, then pair findings with optimization guidance.

## Shortcut Phrases

- analyze this session
- top tools in this session
- did model change mid-session
- assistant token usage summary
- average turns per session

## Inputs

- Session identifier or transcript source
- Time window or turn range (optional)
- Focus area (tooling, tokens, routing, efficiency)

## Analysis Workflow

1. Identify the session scope and pull event/turn data.
2. Aggregate tool invocations and rank top-used tools.
3. Summarize assistant messages, including counts and token totals (or bounded estimates when exact usage is unavailable).
4. Detect model transitions by turn and flag mid-session model changes.
5. Compute turn metrics (total turns, user turns, assistant turns, average turns).
6. Produce optimization actions by pairing with companion skills.

## Paired Skills

| Companion skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `session-optimization` | Convert findings into concrete hygiene actions (`/compact`, `/new`, model downshift, file-reference discipline). |
| `copilot-usage-analytics` | Convert token and routing findings into cost estimates, dispatch ranking, and ROI framing. |

## Output

- Top tools table (count and share)
- Assistant message and token summary
- Model timeline with mid-session change points
- Turn metrics (including average turns)
- Prioritized optimization actions mapped to paired skills
