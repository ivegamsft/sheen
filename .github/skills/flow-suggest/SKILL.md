# Flow Suggest Skill

Use this skill after a flow audit to convert findings into practical fixes with
clear implementation targets.

## When to Use

- Converting audit findings into issue-ready backlog items
- Auto-creating high-confidence issues while drafting lower-confidence items
- Prioritizing queue, CI, and stale-branch remediation work
- Defining measurable acceptance criteria and KPI impact targets
- Sequencing improvements into low-risk waves

## Workflow

1. Ingest findings from `flow-audit`.
2. Normalize remediation options and estimate impact.
3. Prioritize fixes by urgency, effort, and dependency risk.
4. Auto-create high-confidence issues; draft medium-confidence candidates.
5. Publish a sequenced recommendation slate.

## Output

- Prioritized fix list
- Issue-ready recommendation drafts
- Suggested execution waves
