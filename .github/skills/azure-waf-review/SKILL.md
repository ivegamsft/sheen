# Azure Well-Architected Framework Review Skill

Assess Azure workloads against the five WAF pillars, generate scored findings reports, and
produce prioritized remediation guidance with Bicep/Terraform templates.

## Reference Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| [`references/pillar-guide.md`](references/pillar-guide.md) | Five WAF pillars with key concerns, full 7-step assessment workflow, template index, all references |
| [`references/workflow-guardrails.md`](references/workflow-guardrails.md) | Guardrails for scope, secrets, and advisory use; agent pairing guidance |

## Key Patterns

- Score each pillar 1–5; flag findings Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Rank by impact × effort matrix — surface quick wins first
- Never emit secrets or credentials in generated IaC
- Pair with `solution-architect` (full assessment) and `devops-engineer` (IaC remediation)
