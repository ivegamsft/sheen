# Factory State Machine Skill

Model and validate factory state transitions for orchestration workflows.

## Templates in This Skill

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `factory-state-template.json` | Starter `.github/factory-state.json` with states, transitions, and escalation rules |

## Core Rules

- Keep the state file as the single source of truth.
- Model each transition explicitly; do not infer hidden hops.
- Separate automatic transitions from human escalation.
- Make terminal states and rollback states obvious.
- Keep state names and conditions deterministic so workflows can read them safely.

## Agent Pairing

Use with factory orchestration agents that read `.github/factory-state.json` and trigger Workcell workflows.
